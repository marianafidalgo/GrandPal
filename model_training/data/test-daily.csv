test,ordinary_life,"I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ' s why it won ' t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ' s not working either . I suspect that there ' s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ' s causing a blockage . That ' s what ' s making your toilet overflow ."

test,relationship,I could have Suzy stay at my place .
test,relationship,"I don't want to do that to you , Karen ."

test,relationship,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
test,relationship,"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely ."
test,relationship,"I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight ."
test,relationship,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
test,relationship,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
test,relationship,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .

test,work,"Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York ."
test,work,"Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you ."
test,work,How are you getting along with your business ?
test,work,"Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year ."
test,work,"I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance ."
test,ordinary_life,"By the way miss , where is the toilet ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment ."
test,ordinary_life,"What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss ."
test,ordinary_life,You are welcome .
test,ordinary_life,"excuse me , could you tell me which line I ' m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?"
test,ordinary_life,"you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ' ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage ."
test,ordinary_life,that ' s a really long line . How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people ?
test,ordinary_life,"it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait ."
test,ordinary_life,can I buy stamps here ?
test,ordinary_life,sure . How many would you like ?
test,ordinary_life,I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
test,ordinary_life,are you sending them abroad ?
test,ordinary_life,twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
test,ordinary_life,"do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive ."
test,ordinary_life,no .
test,ordinary_life,"ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence ."
test,ordinary_life,and the bubble wrap ?
test,ordinary_life,that ' s another quid .
test,ordinary_life,thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
test,ordinary_life,"Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?"
test,ordinary_life,I am cooking now !
test,ordinary_life,Are you good at cooking ?
test,ordinary_life,"I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !"
test,ordinary_life,It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !
test,ordinary_life,I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty ."
test,ordinary_life,That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
test,ordinary_life,I have the same idea as yours .
test,ordinary_life,It's OK . Please have a taste of it .
test,ordinary_life,"Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious ."
test,ordinary_life,Thank you for your praise .
test,ordinary_life,"Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?"
test,ordinary_life,"I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc ."
test,ordinary_life,"So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?"
test,ordinary_life,Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
test,ordinary_life,Thanks a lot .
test,ordinary_life,It's my pleasure .
test,tourism,Room service . What can I do for you ?
test,tourism,This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .
test,tourism,"Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one . Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?"
test,tourism,"Yes , I ordered the express service ."
test,tourism,"Sir , we are terribly sorry for that . We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?"
test,tourism,That's fine .
test,ordinary_life,I'd like you to do me a favor .
test,ordinary_life,What is it ?
test,ordinary_life,Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
test,ordinary_life,Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
test,ordinary_life,"Excuse me , may I help you ?"
test,ordinary_life,Would you please fill some gas for me ?
test,ordinary_life,Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?
test,ordinary_life,"Unleaded , please ."
test,ordinary_life,OK .
test,work,I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .
test,work,It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
test,work,What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
test,work,All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
test,work,A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
test,work,Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
test,work,I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
test,work,So do I .
test,relationship,"There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?"

test,relationship,She's probably about five feet .
test,relationship,"That's nice , but tell me what she looks like ."
test,relationship,The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
test,relationship,I think I might've bumped into her before .
test,relationship,Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
test,relationship,I believe so .
test,ordinary_life,"Take a seat inside and see what you think . So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary ."

test,ordinary_life,Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
test,ordinary_life,"San Francisco ? No , sir . We only have this office here . You will have to return it here ."

test,ordinary_life,Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .
test,ordinary_life,Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover .
test,ordinary_life,"Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood ."
test,ordinary_life,Sound great . Let's go !
test,ordinary_life,Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious .
test,ordinary_life,True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
test,ordinary_life,You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps .
test,ordinary_life,You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven .
test,ordinary_life,Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
test,ordinary_life,Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .
test,ordinary_life,OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant
test,ordinary_life,Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?
test,ordinary_life,Where do you want to go ?
test,ordinary_life,I'm going to the hospital .
test,ordinary_life,Get in . I'll take you .
test,ordinary_life,About how much will it cost ?
test,ordinary_life,It will cost you $ 10 .
test,ordinary_life,"By the way , what's the time ?"
test,ordinary_life,"You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know ."
test,ordinary_life,It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
test,ordinary_life,Certainly .
test,ordinary_life,You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .
test,ordinary_life,Where was it from ?
test,ordinary_life,It was made in Jingdezhen .
test,ordinary_life,Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
test,ordinary_life,You are right .
test,ordinary_life,This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .
test,ordinary_life,It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .
test,ordinary_life,It must be most precious .
test,ordinary_life,But it is really worth the price .
test,ordinary_life,"Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , Would you do me a favor ?"
test,ordinary_life,Yes ?
test,ordinary_life,Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
test,ordinary_life,Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter ."
test,ordinary_life,Thanks .
test,ordinary_life,you are welcome .
test,ordinary_life,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?"
test,ordinary_life,Alright .
test,ordinary_life,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital ."
test,ordinary_life,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time ."
test,ordinary_life,It really hurts .
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?"
test,ordinary_life,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
test,ordinary_life,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?"
test,ordinary_life,To hell with you .
test,ordinary_life,"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service ."
test,ordinary_life,Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night ."
test,ordinary_life,It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
test,ordinary_life,Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
test,ordinary_life,What about the performance itself ?
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven ."
test,ordinary_life,"Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite ."
test,ordinary_life,It surely is . And the cast is really the best .
test,ordinary_life,Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
test,ordinary_life,"The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back ."
test,work,All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ?
test,work,"Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 ."
test,work,"I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00"
test,work,That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
test,work,"Perhaps one year , I'm not sure ."
test,ordinary_life,What dressing would you like on the salad ?
test,ordinary_life,"French dressing , please ."
test,ordinary_life,I beg your pardon ?
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , French dressing ."
test,ordinary_life,"Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ?"
test,ordinary_life,We still prefer French dressing .

test,ordinary_life,Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .
test,ordinary_life,Thank you .
test,work,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?"
test,work,"Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic ."
test,work,"Yeah , that's very important ."
test,work,"So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment ."
test,work,I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
test,work,"That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes ."
test,work,It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
test,work,"It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications ."
test,work,But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
test,work,"I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes ."
test,work,It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
test,work,"You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous ."
test,work,I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
test,work,You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
test,work,It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
test,work,"It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior ."
test,work,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?"
test,work,No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
test,work,It better be more than last year .
test,work,"Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see ."
test,work,"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed ."
test,work,What a pity !
test,work,"If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?"
test,work,That's OK .
test,finance,"Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ?"
test,finance,Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
test,finance,Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?
test,finance,It's NX567822100007 .
test,finance,Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
test,finance,"OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?"
test,finance,No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
test,tourism,May I help you ?
test,tourism,"Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?"
test,tourism,Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?
test,tourism,I would prefer the first one .
test,tourism,Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .
test,finance,"Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ?"
test,finance,"I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please ."
test,finance,"OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates ."
test,finance,"OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?"
test,finance,"Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds ."
test,finance,"That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !"
test,politics,911 emergency . What is the problem ?
test,politics,I would like to report a break-in .
test,politics,When was this break-in ?
test,politics,I believe it happened last night .
test,politics,Where was the break-in ?
test,politics,It happened at my house .
test,politics,Was anything stolen ?
test,politics,I haven't checked yet .
test,politics,Why do you think there was a break-in ?
test,politics,My front window was broken .
test,politics,We'll send a squad car shortly .
test,politics,I'd appreciate that .
test,ordinary_life,Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ?
test,ordinary_life,One dollar .
test,ordinary_life,"So , I can have five for five dollars ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Actually , you can only have four ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please ."
test,ordinary_life,Okay . Thanks .
test,tourism,House keeping . May I come in ?
test,tourism,Come in please .
test,tourism,"Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?"
test,tourism,"Well , since you have come , do it now please ?"
test,tourism,That's all . Have a nice stay here .
test,tourism,Thank you . Please get some soap for us .
test,tourism,Just a moment . I will do it right now .
test,work,"Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ' m sorry to bother you at home , but I ' Ve got a bit of a problem ."
test,work,Oh ? What ' s wrong ?
test,work,My daughter ' s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ' m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ' ll be about two hours late .
test,work,Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ?
test,work,"Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?"
test,work,"Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks ."
test,work,I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
test,work,"According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position ."
test,work,Then tell me something about your background .
test,work,"My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language ."
test,work,"Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?"
test,work,"The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future ."
test,work,Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
test,work,"Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE ."
test,work,Have you got anything to ask me ?
test,work,"Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?"
test,work,"Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products ."
test,work,I see . This is my advantage .
test,work,Good . Have you got any other questions ?
test,work,No .
test,work,"Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you ."
test,work,"Thank you , bye-bye ."
test,ordinary_life,"Tom , is Jenny crying ?"
test,ordinary_life,Can you take he away from me ?
test,ordinary_life,I ' m just coming for that .
test,ordinary_life,She kept bothering me .
test,ordinary_life,She ' s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ' t you be good to her ?
test,ordinary_life,"But I am her brother , not her servant ."
test,ordinary_life,"Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ?"
test,ordinary_life,Maybe you should look around for an outlet .
test,ordinary_life,That is a wonderful idea .
test,ordinary_life,Outlets have more reasonable prices .
test,ordinary_life,Thank you for your help .
test,ordinary_life,No problem . Good luck
test,ordinary_life,Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ?
test,ordinary_life,The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
test,ordinary_life,"Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?"
test,ordinary_life,"They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship ."
test,ordinary_life,"Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !"
test,ordinary_life,Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
test,ordinary_life,"Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !"
test,ordinary_life,"They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?"
test,ordinary_life,Are they from Taiwan ?
test,ordinary_life,They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
test,ordinary_life,OK . I'll take four kiwis .
test,work,"Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ?"
test,work,sure . What do you need ?
test,work,"well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice ."
test,work,really ? Why ?
test,work,it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go .
test,work,but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
test,work,"well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer ."
test,work,well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?
test,work,"the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time ."
test,work,"it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity ."
test,work,I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .
test,work,"I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?"
test,work,"of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally ."
test,work,thanks . I appreciate that .
test,ordinary_life,What can I show you ?
test,ordinary_life,Do you have this shirt in a small ?
test,ordinary_life,"Let me check . Yes , we have ."
test,ordinary_life,May I try it on ?
test,ordinary_life,Sure . Let me help you .
test,work,"the James ' s file , Christine ?"
test,work,"I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ..."
test,work,"Christine , I know you ' re new here and there ' s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ' t afford to lose an important document ."
test,work,"Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ' s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory ."
test,ordinary_life,I wonder whether I could possibly borrow your new bicycle now .

test,relationship,You can ! With a little practice .
test,relationship,"Look at him , he's buff ."
test,relationship,I think he's hot too .
test,relationship,How do they all get in such tiptop shape ?
test,relationship,Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .
test,relationship,That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day .
test,relationship,"Good for you , Leslie !"
test,ordinary_life,Excuse me . Check please .
test,ordinary_life,"OK , how was everything ?"
test,ordinary_life,Very nice . Thank you .
test,ordinary_life,Would you like this to-go ?

test,ordinary_life,Do you take credit cards ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , we accept Visa and MasterCard ."
test,ordinary_life,"OK , here you are ."

test,work,"I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis ."
test,work,What is your greatest strength ?
test,work,"I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together ."
test,work,What is your greatest weakness ?
test,work,"I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself ."

test,tourism,"We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States ."
test,tourism,"That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously ."
test,ordinary_life,This house is not looking all that great from here
test,ordinary_life,You can ' t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ' s go inside .

test,ordinary_life,I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ' s go check it out .
test,ordinary_life,"The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ' t have any storage space ."

test,ordinary_life,I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
test,ordinary_life,"By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?"

test,work,Thank you .
test,work,"Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time ."
test,work,That's a good idea .
test,work,"First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract ."
test,work,Agreed .
test,work,"For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments ."

test,work,"I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable ."
test,work,"That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 ."
test,work,"That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount ."
test,work,"I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?"
test,work,"Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?"
test,work,All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .
test,work,Very well . Thank you .

test,work,"But if I don't pass , will you call me ?"
test,work,"I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful ."
test,work,Then do I have the chance to get this job ?
test,work,"I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers ."

In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat ."
test,ordinary_life,I think Yoga might be suitable for me .
test,ordinary_life,Why ?
test,ordinary_life,Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
test,ordinary_life,But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
test,ordinary_life,I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
test,ordinary_life,You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .

test,health,Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
test,health,But I can't just slow down .
test,health,"You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size ."
test,health,You mean I've got to lose weight ?
test,health,Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
test,ordinary_life,"You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?"
test,ordinary_life,Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .
test,ordinary_life,"So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities ."
test,ordinary_life,Do you do the same exercises every day ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park ."
test,ordinary_life,Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
test,ordinary_life,"It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally ."
test,ordinary_life,I want some cosmetics . Could you recommend some ?
test,ordinary_life,I think Pond's is the best .

test,ordinary_life,Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
test,ordinary_life,"Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?"
test,ordinary_life,Either way is good for me .
test,ordinary_life,There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?
test,ordinary_life,"I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also ."
test,ordinary_life,"We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home ."
test,ordinary_life,"I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at ."
test,ordinary_life,I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .

test,finance,"Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?"
test,finance,"Actually , the factory is located in Scotland ."
test,finance,Really ? I didn ' t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
test,finance,"That ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ' Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !"
test,finance,"Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ..."
test,finance,"Unique , aren ' t they ? I bet you ' Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ' s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection ."
test,finance,"Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ' s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?"
test,finance,"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ' m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis ."
test,finance,Haggis ? What ' s Haggis ?
test,finance,"It ' s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ' s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ' s stomach ."
test,finance,"Ah , get back to you ."
test,finance,Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ?

test,work,I think I can handle it by myself .
test,work,I ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
test,work,"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ' t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility ."
test,work,Other company rules also need your attention .
test,work,"Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . Yeah , thank you for telling me ."
test,work,Don ' t mention it .
test,relationship,Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !

test,ordinary_life,Why ? What happened ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ' t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ' t look into a couple of different HMO ' s ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah , you ' re right . We aren ' t getting any younger and our kids are getting older ."
test,ordinary_life,"Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ' s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too ."
test,ordinary_life,"Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money ."
test,ordinary_life,"Well , we don ' t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine ."
test,ordinary_life,I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
test,ordinary_life,Not in a million years !

test,ordinary_life,What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
test,ordinary_life,It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
test,ordinary_life,"You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag ."
test,ordinary_life,"The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins ."
test,ordinary_life,Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?

test,tourism,"Just a few minutes , ma'am ."
test,tourism,Great . Thank you .
test,ordinary_life,"Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?"
test,ordinary_life,You really should go to Rachel's pet store .
test,ordinary_life,Why ? anything special there ?
test,ordinary_life,It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?"
test,ordinary_life,Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
test,ordinary_life,That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
test,ordinary_life,Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
test,ordinary_life,Why not ? it's so cool .
test,ordinary_life,But it will pose a risk to your health .
test,ordinary_life,Pardon ?
test,ordinary_life,"I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems ."
test,ordinary_life,"Well , I didn't realize that ."
test,ordinary_life,"I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , good luck , Maria ."
test,tourism,"Hello , this is room 1205 . Our message lamp is flashing ."
test,tourism,"Hold on a minute , please ."
test,tourism,Thank you .
test,tourism,I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you .
test,tourism,Would you bring the message to my room .
test,tourism,I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
test,tourism,Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
test,tourism,"OK , we wait for you ."
test,relationship,guess what ? I've got great news !
test,relationship,what is it ?
test,relationship,"well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?"
test,relationship,yes .
test,relationship,"well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him ."
test,relationship,really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
test,relationship,she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
test,relationship,wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
test,relationship,"it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly ."
test,relationship,are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
test,relationship,"yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !"
test,relationship,do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
test,relationship,"I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you ."
test,relationship,I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
test,relationship,"me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?"
test,relationship,"sure , where would you like to go ?"
test,relationship,perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .
test,relationship,have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?
test,relationship,I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .
test,relationship,"you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish ."
test,relationship,who's the director ?
test,relationship,"it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?"
test,relationship,"yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?"
test,relationship,"sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now ."
test,relationship,"that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?"
test,relationship,no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
test,relationship,how much does the magadize cost ?
test,relationship,"it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon ."
test,relationship,that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?
test,relationship,"Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore ."
test,relationship,"I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !"
test,ordinary_life,Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !
test,ordinary_life,Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .
test,ordinary_life,But you could have saved money .
test,ordinary_life,"From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !"
test,ordinary_life,"F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ..."
test,ordinary_life,Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
test,work,Can you help me do an internet search ?
test,work,Sure . What do you want to find ?
test,work,I want to find information on the American Civil War .
test,work,"Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that ."
test,work,"Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg ."
test,work,"O . K . Well , go to google . com , and type in "" Battle of Gettysburg . """
test,work,"Oh wow , there are a lot of sites ."
test,work,"Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg ."
test,work,Thanks .
test,work,"For detailed information , however , you should read a history book ."
test,work,"Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library ."
test,relationship,I just have to come up for air . I ' Ve been here for too long a time .
test,relationship,OK . You ' d better come back in two hours .
test,work,Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith .
test,work,I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
test,work,Do you know when he will be back ?
test,work,He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
test,work,Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
test,work,The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
test,work,"Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?"
test,work,"Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w ."

test,health,Did you lose any weight ?
test,health,"Yes , I have lost quite a few pounds since last month ."
test,health,When was the last time you had a check-up ?
test,health,About two month ago .
test,health,Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic .
test,health,"Well , Mr . Brown , I'm happy to say it's nothing serious ."
test,health,You're just a little run-down from overwork .
test,health,What am I supposed to do ?
test,health,I think all you need is just a vacation .
test,health,Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest .
test,health,"Thank you , doctor . I'll do as you say ."
test,ordinary_life,"Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ?"

test,ordinary_life,"Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market ."
test,ordinary_life,That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal ."
test,ordinary_life,Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
test,ordinary_life,Can I get my dress today ?
test,ordinary_life,"You have ordered a red dress , is that right ?"
test,ordinary_life,Yes . Is that available now ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , here you are . Try it in front of the mirror ."
test,politics,Did you hear about the robbery ?
test,politics,Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen .
test,politics,Are you serious ?
test,politics,I was there .
test,politics,What happened ?
test,politics,A man came into the bank with a gun .
test,politics,That's insane .
test,politics,I was so scared when I saw the gun .
test,politics,Then what happened ?
test,politics,He took the money and tried to get away .
test,politics,Did the cops show up in time ?
test,politics,He didn't even make it out the door .
test,politics,hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
test,politics,"hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ' m shocked that the pole"
test,politics,people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
test,politics,you mean if they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
test,politics,there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ' t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
test,politics,"well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?"
test,politics,yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
test,politics,"well , they ' Ve got the money and she ' s going tomorrow for treatment ."
test,politics,I ' m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
test,politics,"I ' m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ' m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ' m amazed that I haven ' t even won a small prize yet . It ' s so unfair !"
test,politics,"don ' t be moody ! I hope you ' re not tired , because we ' Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties ."

test,ordinary_life,Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 .
test,ordinary_life,Is it possible for you to reduce the price ?
test,ordinary_life,I am sorry . It's a one-price shop .
test,tourism,This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?
test,tourism,"Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?"
test,tourism,"I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?"
test,tourism,"Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 ."

test,ordinary_life,"No , this isn't ."
test,ordinary_life,Could you please get him on the phone ?
test,ordinary_life,Sure . Wait a minute .
test,ordinary_life,It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .
test,ordinary_life,Why don't you wear a scarf ?
test,ordinary_life,What can wearing one do for me ?
test,ordinary_life,You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough .
test,ordinary_life,So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
test,ordinary_life,Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
test,ordinary_life,"You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers ."
test,ordinary_life,I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
test,ordinary_life,"Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver ."

test,work,"Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ?"
test,work,"Yes , I've been observing them ."
test,work,"When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?"
test,work,I already have something to wear .

test,ordinary_life,Certainly . Here you are .
test,ordinary_life,It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?
test,ordinary_life,Four hundred yuan .
test,ordinary_life,That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ?
test,ordinary_life,I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
test,ordinary_life,"Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it ."
test,ordinary_life,"Well , I'll have it wrapped for you ."
test,ordinary_life,Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan .
test,ordinary_life,Thank you . Please come again .
test,ordinary_life,It ' s so great to be here ! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
test,ordinary_life,We ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
test,ordinary_life,"That ' d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Sure , I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen ."
test,ordinary_life,"That would be lovely , thanks ."
test,ordinary_life,Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
test,ordinary_life,"I ' ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup ."
test,ordinary_life,Ok . What do you think about our living room ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient ."
test,ordinary_life,My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here ."
test,ordinary_life,"Your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming ."
test,ordinary_life,"I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ' m here . You two could probably use my help ."
test,ordinary_life,"That ' s very nice of you to offer . Here ' s your tea . Be careful , it ' s still quite hot ."
test,ordinary_life,"my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place ."
test,ordinary_life,I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
test,ordinary_life,Do you know any places ?
test,ordinary_life,well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
test,ordinary_life,thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
test,ordinary_life,how much do are you looking to spend ?
test,ordinary_life,"I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month ."
test,ordinary_life,looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
test,ordinary_life,"it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route ."
test,ordinary_life,anything you need to have in the place ?
test,ordinary_life,"I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side ."
test,ordinary_life,you can also check out university bulletin boards .
test,ordinary_life,why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
test,ordinary_life,"not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent ."
test,ordinary_life,thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
test,ordinary_life,good luck .
test,ordinary_life,"Good afternoon , how may I help you ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Hi , I'd like to order some flowers ."
test,ordinary_life,Who are they for ?
test,ordinary_life,They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha .
test,ordinary_life,What kind of flowers would you like ?
test,ordinary_life,I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ?
test,ordinary_life,OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
test,ordinary_life,Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .

test,ordinary_life,241 Main street .
test,health,"What do you think I should do , doctor ?"
test,health,Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ?
test,health,Is it useful for me ?
test,health,You have to try at least .
test,health,OK . Thanks a lot .
test,health,That's nothing .
test,ordinary_life,What do you need today ?
test,ordinary_life,I need to take a few classes .
test,ordinary_life,What kind of classes would you like to take ?
test,ordinary_life,How about a driver's course ?
test,ordinary_life,"Okay , you're going to need to make an appointment ."
test,ordinary_life,I don't understand why I need to make an appointment .
test,ordinary_life,You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork .
test,ordinary_life,I'd like to make one now if I could .
test,ordinary_life,Sure you can ; when would you like to come in ?

test,health,"Does he have a temperature , doctor ?"

test,health,"Yes . He must remain in bed for another two days . He can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . Where's Mr Williams this evening ?"

test,work,"In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now ."
test,work,"Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ?"
test,work,"Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here ."
test,ordinary_life,"This looks wonderful , Madame Culot ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu ."
test,ordinary_life,Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
test,ordinary_life,Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good .
test,ordinary_life,Mmm . Maybe another time .
test,ordinary_life,"You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious ."
test,ordinary_life,Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes ."
test,ordinary_life,I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?
test,ordinary_life,I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yes . That would be lovely ."
test,ordinary_life,"Hi , could we have two orange juice smoothies ?"
test,ordinary_life,Would you like those with yogurt ?
test,ordinary_life,"Sure , why not ?"
test,ordinary_life,What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
test,ordinary_life,Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
test,ordinary_life,It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
test,ordinary_life,"Wow , Amy , look at that number ."
test,ordinary_life,What's so great about it ?
test,ordinary_life,What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
test,ordinary_life,"Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that ."
test,ordinary_life,I love that kind of stuff .
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah , you seem to like those styles ."
test,ordinary_life,Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .

test,work,I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ?
test,work,"We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences ."
test,work,"Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?"
test,work,"Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?"
test,work,"Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go ."
test,work,Good idea .
test,ordinary_life,"Excuse me , sir . Is there a barber near here ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road ."
test,ordinary_life,"I'm a stranger here . How can I get there , please ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right ."
test,ordinary_life,Thank you very much .
test,finance,"Unfortunately , according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes ."
test,finance,"So , this 500 RIB is worthless ?"

test,ordinary_life,"Come on , it ' s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging ."
test,ordinary_life,"It ' s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere ."
test,ordinary_life,"A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room ."
test,ordinary_life,But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
test,ordinary_life,But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
test,ordinary_life,"I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away ."
test,ordinary_life,"But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches ."
test,ordinary_life,"I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should ."
test,ordinary_life,"Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree ."
test,ordinary_life,"I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church ."
test,ordinary_life,"Welcome , how may I help you today ?"
test,ordinary_life,"I'm ask for a pizza , please ."
test,ordinary_life,Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one .
test,ordinary_life,"You're right , that is great ."
test,ordinary_life,What size would you like ?
test,ordinary_life,"Medium one will be perfect , thank you"
test,ordinary_life,Which kind do you want ?
test,ordinary_life,I like seafood on my pizza .
test,ordinary_life,We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab .
test,ordinary_life,Tuna sounds good today .
test,ordinary_life,Would that be for here or take away ?
test,ordinary_life,That would be to go .

test,work,"So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ..."
test,work,"No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO -- the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased ."
test,work,How many people are on the board of directors ?
test,work,"Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line ."
test,work,"How much will my pay be , if you don ' t mind my asking ?"

test,work,"Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?"
test,work,No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Mum , can I finish my homework later ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,Sorry . You know the rules .
test,attitude_and_emotion,But I want to watch TV now .
test,attitude_and_emotion,That ' s out of the question .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Please .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Not a chance .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Not even for an hour ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Sorry , it ' s impossible ."
test,ordinary_life,"Where ' s Sally , Jack ?"

test,ordinary_life,Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ?
test,ordinary_life,"Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color ."
test,ordinary_life,Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .

test,work,Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
test,work,"We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose ."
test,work,"OK , but don't tell anyone what I said ."
test,ordinary_life,You get your bus pass ?
test,ordinary_life,I'm not going to buy one .
test,ordinary_life,You're not ?
test,ordinary_life,I think it's a waste of money .
test,ordinary_life,It actually costs less if you have a bus pass .
test,ordinary_life,How is that ?
test,ordinary_life,You can use it however many times you need to .
test,ordinary_life,Is that right ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket ."
test,ordinary_life,That sounds nice .
test,ordinary_life,You should go get yours .

test,ordinary_life,I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
test,ordinary_life,Banana pie .
test,ordinary_life,Where shall we sit ?
test,ordinary_life,How about there ?
test,ordinary_life,Do you like cooking ?
test,ordinary_life,I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ?
test,ordinary_life,"I don ' t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ' t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away ."
test,ordinary_life,You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .
test,ordinary_life,So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .
test,ordinary_life,"Italian , Indian and chinese . I ' Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice ."
test,ordinary_life,Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?
test,ordinary_life,"Not at all . You can find most of them in supermarkets . The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients ."
test,ordinary_life,How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
test,ordinary_life,"Obviously , it depends on what I ' m cooking . But I ' d say it generally takes about one and a half hours ."

test,ordinary_life,"Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think ."
test,ordinary_life,"That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?"
test,ordinary_life,One last question
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , no . Everything we sell here is "" as is . """
test,ordinary_life,I guess I was asking for too much .
test,ordinary_life,"If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet ."
test,ordinary_life,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
test,ordinary_life,Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
test,ordinary_life,Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
test,ordinary_life,"I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !"
test,ordinary_life,"What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog ."
test,ordinary_life,Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
test,ordinary_life,"We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house ."
test,ordinary_life,Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !

test,relationship,"John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year ."
test,relationship,"I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska ."
test,relationship,You can't be serious !
test,relationship,"Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you ."
test,relationship,"After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together ."
test,relationship,Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
test,relationship,"You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !"
test,relationship,Whatever you say !
test,ordinary_life,Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
test,ordinary_life,Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
test,ordinary_life,I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
test,ordinary_life,"If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined ."
test,ordinary_life,What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .

test,ordinary_life,What happened ?
test,ordinary_life,"I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me ."
test,ordinary_life,What ? He can't do this to you .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know ."
test,ordinary_life,What did you do ?
test,ordinary_life,I shouted it back of course .
test,ordinary_life,"Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?"
test,ordinary_life,What would you do if you were in my shoes ?
test,ordinary_life,"Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him ."
test,ordinary_life,"No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault ."
test,ordinary_life,"I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate ."
test,ordinary_life,I am too angry to do that .
test,ordinary_life,"Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere ."
test,ordinary_life,Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .

test,ordinary_life,What game do you like ?
test,ordinary_life,I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
test,ordinary_life,"I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated ."
test,ordinary_life,"It ' s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn ."
test,ordinary_life,I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
test,ordinary_life,"I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money ."
test,ordinary_life,Do you play bridge ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game ."
test,ordinary_life,"I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game ."

test,work,What do you think about the equipment in our company ?
test,work,We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible .

test,ordinary_life,It's simple . You can use call transfer .
test,ordinary_life,Is it so simple ?
test,ordinary_life,"Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls ."
test,ordinary_life,It's true .
test,ordinary_life,"Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call ."
test,ordinary_life,That's all ?
test,ordinary_life,"In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved ."

test,ordinary_life,I don ' t understand why .
test,ordinary_life,I ' m going to have to keep your deposit
test,ordinary_life,Why can ' t I have it back ?
test,ordinary_life,Because you ' re leaving before your lease is over .
test,ordinary_life,You have to give it back to me .
test,ordinary_life,You ' re not going to get it .
test,ordinary_life,But I ' m not able to live here anymore .

test,ordinary_life,I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
test,ordinary_life,Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
test,ordinary_life,Have you tried this one ? It ' s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .

test,ordinary_life,"That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings ."
test,ordinary_life,OK . Anything else ?
test,ordinary_life,Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .

test,ordinary_life,"Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible ."
test,ordinary_life,What ' the matter ?
test,ordinary_life,"The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone ."
test,ordinary_life,I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district ."
test,ordinary_life,That's true .
test,ordinary_life,"Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?"
test,ordinary_life,It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
test,ordinary_life,You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy ."
test,ordinary_life,"I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?"
test,ordinary_life,You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places ."
test,ordinary_life,Seriously ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah , it's hard to believe but true ."

test,ordinary_life,"Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico ."
test,ordinary_life,"Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !"
test,ordinary_life,"Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year ."
test,ordinary_life,Good idea !

We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ..."
test,finance,That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
test,work,I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .
test,work,"It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !"
test,work,Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
test,work,Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .
test,ordinary_life,"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?"

test,finance,I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ?
test,finance,I'd be glad to .
test,finance,I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .
test,finance,Do you have an account with this bank ?
test,finance,I'm afraid not .
test,finance,In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .
test,finance,What is the interest rate on your card ?
test,finance,The annual charge rate is 9 . 5 % .
test,finance,That's very expensive !
test,finance,Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
test,finance,How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
test,finance,You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
test,finance,Does the card provide any other benefits ?

test,relationship,"In the same way , probably ."
test,work,Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
test,work,"Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume ."
test,work,But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
test,work,"Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume ."
test,work,"It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?"
test,work,"Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer ."
test,work,Why not come over to work in my company ?
test,work,I need to think it over .
test,work,Tell me what you need .
test,work,"All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable ."

test,relationship,did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?

test,relationship,what were the results of the game ?
test,relationship,it ended in a tie .
test,relationship,what was the actual score ?

test,relationship,"if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won ."
test,relationship,what happened ?
test,relationship,"their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway ."
test,relationship,that explains it .

test,relationship,"sure , that would be great ."
test,relationship,"Ok , it's a date then !"
test,relationship,how are you ?
test,relationship,"I ' m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ' s hard to keep track of everything around here ."
test,relationship,"That ' s for sure . You ' re new , too , huh ?"
test,relationship,Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ?
test,ordinary_life,"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it ."
test,ordinary_life,"Gave me the receipt , please ."
test,ordinary_life,Here is my receipt .
test,ordinary_life,What's wrong with it ?
test,ordinary_life,It's too small for me to wear .
test,ordinary_life,Would you like another bigger one ?
test,ordinary_life,No thanks . I want to have a refund .
test,ordinary_life,"OK , here is your money ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , so many kinds of winter hats ."
test,ordinary_life,"What is your favorite color , miss ?"
test,ordinary_life,Red .
test,ordinary_life,Here you are . It ' s very attractive .
test,ordinary_life,May I try it on ?
test,ordinary_life,Go ahead .
test,ordinary_life,Is there a mirror around here ?
test,ordinary_life,Right over there .
test,ordinary_life,Does it suit me ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , you look very nice ."
test,ordinary_life,How much is it ?
test,ordinary_life,We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
test,ordinary_life,That's quite reasonable .
test,ordinary_life,What can I help you with ?
test,ordinary_life,May I ask you something ?
test,ordinary_life,What's your question ?
test,ordinary_life,How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
test,ordinary_life,What do you need to take it for ?
test,ordinary_life,I'm trying to get my license .
test,ordinary_life,You need six hours .
test,ordinary_life,Can I do all six hours in one day ?
test,ordinary_life,You have to do it in three days .
test,ordinary_life,That's all I have to do ?
test,ordinary_life,That's everything .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , that's a relief ."
test,ordinary_life,"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you ."
test,ordinary_life,Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .
test,ordinary_life,"An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?"
test,ordinary_life,I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes ."
test,ordinary_life,It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
test,ordinary_life,All right . Thank you .
test,ordinary_life,"Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one ."
test,ordinary_life,I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing ."
test,health,Here you are . You left the medicine here .
test,health,Sorry . I was too worried .
test,health,I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
test,health,"Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?"
test,health,"Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold ."
test,health,I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
test,health,It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
test,ordinary_life,What kind of place shall we rent ?
test,ordinary_life,"It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up ."
test,ordinary_life,Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
test,ordinary_life,"Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?"
test,ordinary_life,"I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home ."
test,ordinary_life,"Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early ."
test,ordinary_life,How much do you think the rent will be ?
test,ordinary_life,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
test,health,I have a terrible toothache .
test,health,Which tooth is it ?
test,health,This one here .
test,health,"Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity ."
test,health,Can you fill it ?
test,health,I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
test,health,Then I might as well have it done now .
test,health,"you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days ."
test,ordinary_life,"May I have a look at that vase , please ?"
test,ordinary_life,Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive ."
test,ordinary_life,Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
test,ordinary_life,Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?
test,ordinary_life,The local newspaper has ads for housing .
test,ordinary_life,Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
test,ordinary_life,Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
test,ordinary_life,What do landlords charge for rent ?
test,ordinary_life,"Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?"
test,ordinary_life,"There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment ."
test,ordinary_life,You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
test,ordinary_life,I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
test,ordinary_life,"Sure , I ' ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want ."
test,tourism,"Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?"
test,tourism,With pleasure .
test,tourism,I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
test,tourism,No problem .
test,work,The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge .
test,work,"Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford ."
test,work,Why is the price so high ?
test,work,"It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly ."
test,work,Model of computers aren't compatible ?
test,work,Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
test,work,"Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable ."
test,work,"But by then , the technology will be outdated ."
test,work,"True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge ."
test,work,"That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable ."
test,work,"This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product ."
test,work,I guess you get what you pay for .
test,ordinary_life,What kind of permanent would you like to have ?
test,ordinary_life,what kinds do you have ?

test,ordinary_life,"Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please ."
test,tourism,Hello ! How do I get more amenities ?
test,tourism,"I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand ."
test,tourism,"I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo ."
test,tourism,"Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities ."
test,tourism,"No , no . I've got plenty left ."
test,tourism,Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
test,tourism,What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
test,tourism,"Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !"
test,tourism,"Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs ."
test,tourism,"Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount ."
test,tourism,Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
test,tourism,"I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment ."
test,ordinary_life,Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes ."
test,ordinary_life,That doesn't sound too bad .
test,ordinary_life,"Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo ."
test,ordinary_life,Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
test,ordinary_life,You're welcome .
test,ordinary_life,"I'd like to order breakfast , please ."
test,ordinary_life,"What'd you like , madam ?"
test,ordinary_life,Two muffins and a cup of coffee . Will it take long ?

test,finance,What were you supposed to write it out for ?
test,finance,I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
test,finance,I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
test,finance,That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
test,ordinary_life,"Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ?"
test,ordinary_life,Yes . Thank you .
test,ordinary_life,Would you care for a drink before you order ?
test,ordinary_life,A glass of Qingdao beer .
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?"
test,ordinary_life,Will you make some recommendation ?
test,tourism,"I ' m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ?"
test,tourism,"Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there ."
test,tourism,Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?
test,tourism,"Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?"

test,ordinary_life,"Oh , I nearly forgot the exams ."
test,ordinary_life,"You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow ."
test,ordinary_life,An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
test,ordinary_life,"I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed ."
test,ordinary_life,"No , now it's bedtime ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes ."
test,ordinary_life,I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
test,ordinary_life,"Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?"
test,ordinary_life,That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them ."
test,ordinary_life,"I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans ."
test,ordinary_life,"I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday ."
test,ordinary_life,"Well , it's all new stock in the window now ."
test,ordinary_life,"May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing ."
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot ."
test,ordinary_life,"Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color ."
test,ordinary_life,"That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for ."
test,ordinary_life,"There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones ."
test,work,I've come to hear about your offer .

test,work,I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
test,work,You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
test,work,I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
test,work,"But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with ."
test,work,I agree that yours are of the top .
test,work,"Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?"
test,work,"To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help ."
test,work,Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
test,work,Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
test,tourism,So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor .
test,tourism,"Four is an unlucky number here , Peter . Four sounds like death in Chinese . Hotels often have no fourth floor ."
test,tourism,"I see . Oh , I know what I wanted to ask . How much should I tip this guy ?"
test,tourism,"People don't usually tip here , but you can . Fifty dollars should be more enough ."
test,tourism,Hello ! This is Ruby speaking from G . O . T . International Travel Agency . What can I do for you ?

test,tourism,Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?
test,tourism,"An aisle seat , please . I ' m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often ."
test,tourism,No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic
test,tourism,What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ?
test,tourism,Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
test,tourism,What happens if I can ' t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
test,tourism,"Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation ."
test,tourism,That ' s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
test,tourism,"On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds ."
test,tourism,That ' s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ' m all set . You ' re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .
test,tourism,Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip !

test,work,"Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week ."
test,work,Let ' s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
test,work,Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
test,ordinary_life,That looks graceful on you .
test,ordinary_life,Thank you . But it is too bright for me .
test,ordinary_life,How about this brown one ?
test,ordinary_life,Let me try it on . I like that color .
test,ordinary_life,"Ok , i will get one for your . Here you are ."
test,ordinary_life,But it is too loose . Do you have the smaller size ?
test,ordinary_life,"Sorry , it had been sold out ."
test,ordinary_life,What a pity !
test,finance,I ' d like to apply for a personal loan .

test,ordinary_life,I wouldn't mind having one myself ...
test,ordinary_life,Model it for me .
test,ordinary_life,OK !
test,ordinary_life,Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !
test,finance,"Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?"
test,finance,"I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?"
test,finance,"That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service ."
test,finance,A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
test,finance,"A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle ."
test,finance,"But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you ."
test,finance,"We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies ."
test,finance,"I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free ."
test,ordinary_life,Hello .
test,ordinary_life,Hi . It ' s Tony calling from the dentist ' s office . Is Lily there ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , Lily is not here at the moment ."

test,ordinary_life,So what do you think of my new dress ?
test,ordinary_life,"I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment ."
test,ordinary_life,"Um , ninety-five dollars ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?"
test,ordinary_life,I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
test,ordinary_life,"Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?"
test,ordinary_life,"I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive ."
test,ordinary_life,Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?
test,ordinary_life,I did . Why ?
test,ordinary_life,Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again ."
test,ordinary_life,Is it Fred's fault ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , I don't suppose he's to blame . The man in the other car made a mistake ."
test,ordinary_life,But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
test,work,"In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner ."
test,work,How to adjust ?
test,work,"Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes ."
test,work,"Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas ."
test,work,"That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably ."
test,work,"Yes , sometimes the differences are great ."
test,work,"Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product ."
test,work,We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
test,ordinary_life,I hate doing the damn laundry .
test,ordinary_life,Watch your language .

test,ordinary_life,That's the one .
test,ordinary_life,You mean we'll share the taxi ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully ."

test,work,"Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week ."
test,ordinary_life,That dress is very pretty . Why don ' t you like it ?
test,ordinary_life,It ' s too loud .
test,ordinary_life,We ' Ve been looking around for many hours . What on earth are you looking for ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me ."
test,ordinary_life,What style do you want ?
test,ordinary_life,"I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight ."
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , I see . How about the color ?"
test,ordinary_life,Quiet color .
test,ordinary_life,I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
test,ordinary_life,Really ? Let ' s go there .
test,ordinary_life,"Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?"
test,ordinary_life,Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
test,ordinary_life,I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
test,ordinary_life,"Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?"
test,ordinary_life,I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
test,ordinary_life,"I'm not , I am a vegan ."
test,ordinary_life,A what ?
test,ordinary_life,"A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood ."
test,ordinary_life,Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
test,ordinary_life,"It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult ."
test,relationship,How do you feel about that restaurant ?
test,relationship,It wasn't all that great .
test,relationship,What did you dislike the most ?
test,relationship,I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .
test,relationship,Did you think that the food was any good ?
test,relationship,I wasn't all that impressed by the food .
test,relationship,The service certainly could have been better .
test,relationship,The service did not help the situation .

test,ordinary_life,I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
test,ordinary_life,"I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ' t surprised when you move in ."
test,ordinary_life,Wouldn ' t the owners have told me about any problems ?
test,ordinary_life,"Sellers aren ' t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ' t aware of ."
test,ordinary_life,Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
test,ordinary_life,You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .
test,ordinary_life,What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
test,ordinary_life,There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .
test,relationship,How you celebrate your Valentine ' s Day with your wife ?
test,relationship,I will take a rain check .

test,work,How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?
test,work,"With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired ."

test,work,Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?

test,ordinary_life,Sounds reasonable .
test,ordinary_life,We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
test,ordinary_life,And fruits !
test,ordinary_life,Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
test,ordinary_life,I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health ."
test,ordinary_life,"I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track ."

test,finance,What's your main range ?
test,finance,"Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products ."
test,finance,I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .
test,finance,"To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price ."
test,finance,"Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc ."
test,ordinary_life,I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something .

test,ordinary_life,"Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over ."
test,ordinary_life,I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?
test,ordinary_life,Go right ahead .
test,ordinary_life,"Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room"

test,ordinary_life,"You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help ."

test,school_life,"More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ' t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be ."

test,work,I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
test,work,What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
test,work,"The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior ."
test,work,How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
test,work,"I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react ."
test,work,Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
test,work,"I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks .

Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed ."
test,work,How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
test,work,"I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week ."
test,work,Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
test,work,I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
test,work,"Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?"
test,work,"Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !"
test,work,I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
test,work,Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
test,work,It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
test,work,I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .
test,work,"You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you ."
test,work,What did he say ?
test,work,"He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming ."
test,work,He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .
test,ordinary_life,Want to send out for some Chinese ?
test,ordinary_life,Some what ?
test,ordinary_life,"Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat ."
test,ordinary_life,"No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like ."
test,ordinary_life,Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered ."
test,ordinary_life,What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
test,ordinary_life,Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
test,work,Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?
test,work,I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
test,work,"It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills ."
test,work,Is that true ?
test,work,Definitely !
test,work,"If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone ."
test,ordinary_life,"Hello sir , how may I help you ?"
test,ordinary_life,"I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice ."
test,ordinary_life,"I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?"
test,ordinary_life,"It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry ."
test,ordinary_life,Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
test,ordinary_life,I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
test,ordinary_life,"Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you ."
test,ordinary_life,I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
test,ordinary_life,"I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier ."
test,ordinary_life,"Get out of my store , you jerk !"
test,tourism,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?
test,tourism,"I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel ."
test,tourism,You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
test,tourism,I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
test,tourism,"Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well ."
test,tourism,"Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list ."
test,tourism,How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
test,tourism,Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
test,politics,How do you think they could be ended ?
test,politics,I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
test,politics,"So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them ."
test,politics,"It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries ."
test,politics,"Yes , it is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive ."
test,work,You still have not given me those files I ' Ve asked you for .
test,work,"I ' m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ' Ve just been so busy today ."
test,work,"I really don ' t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ' re running a busy office here . You ' re going to have to keep up ."
test,work,"You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now ."
test,work,What sort of job would you like to take ?
test,work,I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
test,work,We need an operator now .
test,work,It's just the job I've been searching for .
test,politics,I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .
test,politics,I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
test,politics,And it takes up all the news .
test,politics,The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
test,politics,"It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public ."
test,politics,Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
test,politics,I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
test,politics,Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
test,work,"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?"
test,work,I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
test,work,Sure . No problem .
test,work,"Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?"
test,work,Sure . Do you have my number ?
test,work,"Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this ."
test,work,No problem . I'll wait for your call .
test,work,What are you typing there ?
test,work,I'm working on my resume .
test,work,Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?
test,work,"Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet ."
test,work,Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
test,work,I didn ' t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .
test,work,Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .
test,work,Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
test,work,But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .
test,work,How do you know if you don ' t have a try ?
test,ordinary_life,Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
test,ordinary_life,Is this the one you want ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , the one next to it ."
test,ordinary_life,Here you are .
test,ordinary_life,Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?
test,ordinary_life,It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , please . How much is it ?"
test,ordinary_life,It costs $ 200 .
test,ordinary_life,It looks good . OK . I'll take it .
test,relationship,"Happy birthday , Jim !"
test,relationship,"Thank you , Lisa ."
test,relationship,Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
test,relationship,"Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time ."
test,relationship,I'm very glad to hear that .
test,relationship,"Come here , let me introduce some friends to you ."
test,health,What's wrong with you ? You look pale .
test,health,"I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold ."
test,health,When did the trouble start ?
test,health,I was sick most of the night .
test,health,It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
test,health,Have I got a high fever ?
test,health,"Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?"
test,health,"Yes , I have ."
test,health,"Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '"
test,health,"Aaaaahh , aaaaahh ."
test,health,"Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests ."
test,health,"All right , thanks ."
test,health,The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
test,health,What shall I do today ?
test,health,"I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription ."
test,tourism,I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
test,tourism,"You can be sure of that , sir ."
test,tourism,Thank you .
test,ordinary_life,I called HP about my computer .
test,ordinary_life,What did they say ?
test,ordinary_life,They said I need a new hard drive .
test,ordinary_life,That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
test,ordinary_life,"It's not too much , only about $ 85 ."
test,ordinary_life,Plus installation ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace ."
test,ordinary_life,Really ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , it's just a couple of screws ."
test,ordinary_life,That's nice .
test,ordinary_life,It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
test,ordinary_life,"If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you ."
test,ordinary_life,"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class ."
test,ordinary_life,Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , Mum ."
test,ordinary_life,Is there anything wrong ?
test,ordinary_life,I ' m worried about my daughter . She can ' t decide about college .
test,ordinary_life,Don ' t worry . That ' s just a part of being a teenager .
test,ordinary_life,I don ' t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .
test,ordinary_life,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ' t affect her decision .
test,ordinary_life,But I just want to give her some tips .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , she can make her own decisions ."
test,ordinary_life,I guess you are right .
test,ordinary_life,Believe me . Everything will be ok .
test,ordinary_life,I hope so .
test,tourism,It's beautiful here .
test,tourism,Yes . I feel refreshed .
test,tourism,How long will we dock ?
test,tourism,In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
test,tourism,Yes . We come at the right time .
test,ordinary_life,"that was a really good meal , Gordon ."
test,ordinary_life,It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .
test,ordinary_life,"well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home ."
test,ordinary_life,you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
test,ordinary_life,let's see how much the bill is .
test,ordinary_life,don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
test,ordinary_life,what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
test,ordinary_life,"no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't ."
test,ordinary_life,"no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill ."
test,ordinary_life,"alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill ."
test,ordinary_life,"that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk ."
test,ordinary_life,"just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?"
test,ordinary_life,you've got a deal .
test,ordinary_life,great . Bye .
test,ordinary_life,bye .
test,tourism,I hear you are planning to travel abroad .
test,tourism,Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?
test,tourism,"In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles ."
test,tourism,Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .
test,tourism,"Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight ."
test,tourism,And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .
test,ordinary_life,This looks like a very nice house .
test,ordinary_life,"You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it ."
test,ordinary_life,The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !
test,ordinary_life,The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
test,ordinary_life,This home is gorgeous on the inside !
test,ordinary_life,"Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new ."
test,ordinary_life,The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
test,ordinary_life,Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
test,ordinary_life,I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
test,ordinary_life,The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
test,ordinary_life,"There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room ."
test,ordinary_life,"I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind ."
test,tourism,Room service . What can I do for you ?
test,tourism,l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
test,tourism,"Sorry sir , we will bring you one . Anything else ?"
test,tourism,Yes . Bring me a bath towel as well .
test,tourism,Good afternoon . British Airline . Is there any thing I can do for you ?
test,tourism,Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ?
test,tourism,Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?
test,tourism,Next Monday .
test,tourism,Will that be first class or economy seat ?
test,tourism,What's the fare for a first class seat ?
test,tourism,$ 200 .
test,tourism,Oh . I am not a wall streeter . Give me an economy one please .
test,finance,"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?"
test,finance,"Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit ."
test,finance,"That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate ."
test,finance,And I can purchase that here ?
test,finance,"Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle ."
test,tourism,Are there any beds vacant ?
test,tourism,"Yes , what kind of room do you want ?"
test,tourism,"I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower ."
test,tourism,"Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower ."
test,tourism,"Well , that's fine ."
test,finance,Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
test,finance,That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
test,finance,You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
test,finance,"Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t"
test,finance,"Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?"
test,finance,"Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff ."
test,finance,"Well , welcome to the team ."
test,tourism,Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .
test,tourism,"Oh , thank you ."
test,tourism,Is there anything I can do for you now ?
test,tourism,Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .
test,tourism,"Certainly , sir ."
test,work,Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?
test,work,Marry Lin please .
test,work,"Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone ."
test,work,"All right , could I leave a message ?"
test,work,Certainly !
test,work,Please ask her to call John .
test,tourism,Excuse me . Where is the way out ?
test,tourism,"Well , that's what I'm looking for myself ."
test,tourism,"It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?"
test,tourism,"Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?"
test,tourism,It should be the way out .
test,tourism,OK . Let's go and see .
test,ordinary_life,"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough ."
test,ordinary_life,"Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now ."
test,ordinary_life,I think you should be more careful next time .
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that ."
test,work,"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project ."
test,work,"Look , Sally . I ' Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else ."
test,work,"No , I ' m sorry . I disagree . I don ' t think you ' Ve been working at full speed at all ."
test,work,Well . I ' m sorry you feel that way .
test,relationship,"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?"
test,relationship,"Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?"
test,relationship,"Things are going well for me , Joe ."
test,relationship,Want to go see a movie tonight ?
test,relationship,My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
test,relationship,"Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?"
test,relationship,What movie did you want to see ?
test,relationship,There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
test,relationship,"I was thinking that I would like to see "" The Secret Life of Bees . """
test,relationship,Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
test,ordinary_life,How's the bride-to-be ?
test,ordinary_life,Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
test,ordinary_life,"Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !"
test,ordinary_life,I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
test,ordinary_life,Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
test,ordinary_life,"You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ..."
test,ordinary_life,I will . Don't worry !
test,ordinary_life,Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?
test,ordinary_life,"Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk ."
test,ordinary_life,Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
test,ordinary_life,"I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator ."
test,ordinary_life,Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
test,ordinary_life,Nothing .
test,ordinary_life,What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
test,ordinary_life,Promise that you won't get angry .
test,ordinary_life,"OK , I promise . What is it ?"
test,ordinary_life,It's a kitty .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house ."
test,ordinary_life,"Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble ."
test,ordinary_life,No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .
test,ordinary_life,"Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame ."
test,ordinary_life,All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
test,ordinary_life,"I will . Thank you , Mummy ."
test,school_life,I was wondering if you could help me with something .
test,school_life,"Sure , anything you say ."
test,school_life,"Actually , it ' s a little bit silly ."
test,school_life,"Don ' t worry about it , just ask ."
test,school_life,What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
test,school_life,You need to know the type of shoes you want .
test,school_life,Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
test,school_life,"The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low ."
test,school_life,Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
test,work,Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?
test,work,It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
test,work,"So , it has a history for more than a decade ?"
test,work,Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
test,finance,"What can I do for you , Madam ?"
test,finance,Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?
test,finance,"Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?"
test,finance,"Well , everything really ."
test,finance,"All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in ."
test,ordinary_life,Let's do something outdoors today .
test,ordinary_life,All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .
test,ordinary_life,Okay . what do you want to do ?
test,ordinary_life,I want to go jogging .
test,ordinary_life,All right . That sounds like fun .
test,tourism,Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month . This is my reservation note .
test,tourism,"I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently . You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled ."
test,tourism,"But I have been so busy all these days . Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one ."
test,ordinary_life,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
test,ordinary_life,Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .
test,ordinary_life,"No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested ."
test,ordinary_life,"You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other ."
test,ordinary_life,Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely ."
test,ordinary_life,Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
test,ordinary_life,"Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate ."
test,work,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?
test,work,"We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock ."
test,work,"You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order ."
test,work,"OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?"
test,work,"I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time ."
test,work,"OK , will do ."
test,ordinary_life,"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas ."
test,ordinary_life,What size do you want ?
test,ordinary_life,I wear size 40 .
test,ordinary_life,How about this one ? It's the latest design .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , I like the color ."
test,ordinary_life,May I help you ?
test,ordinary_life,I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
test,ordinary_life,What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
test,ordinary_life,I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ?
test,ordinary_life,"Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive ."
test,ordinary_life,How much are they ?
test,ordinary_life,They are $ 168 .
test,ordinary_life,I'll take them .
test,work,A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?
test,work,I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?
test,work,"Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals ."
test,work,"Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills ."
test,work,"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance ."
test,work,"Ok , then we can sign up for it together ."
test,relationship,Who's it knocking at the door ?
test,relationship,I think it's the postman . Will you go and open the door ?
test,relationship,All right . I'll get it .
test,ordinary_life,Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?
test,ordinary_life,"No , we don't ."
test,ordinary_life,"How many of you , please ?"
test,ordinary_life,"Six , including two kids ."
test,ordinary_life,I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .
test,health,"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today ."
test,health,"If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results ."
test,health,Are you saying that there weren ' t any problems ?
test,health,I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
test,health,Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
test,health,"Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about ."
test,health,How will I know what the numbers mean ?
test,health,You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
test,health,How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
test,health,We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
test,work,"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee ."
test,work,If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
test,work,What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
test,work,I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
test,work,What's your proposal ?
test,work,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway ."
test,work,Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
test,work,What would you suggest ?
test,work,The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
test,work,That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
test,work,OK . We can meet halfway again .

test,ordinary_life,"Oh , you mean Canal Street ?"
test,ordinary_life,That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
test,ordinary_life,"Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?"

test,work,What happens if you exceed the limits ?
test,work,We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .

test,ordinary_life,"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable ."
test,ordinary_life,"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness ."
test,ordinary_life,"It ' s easy to say , but I will try ."
test,ordinary_life,"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire ."
test,ordinary_life,"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ' t work , instead he picks up another bad habit ."
test,work,How can I help you ?
test,work,"Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith ."

test,work,"Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock ."

test,relationship,they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
test,relationship,I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
test,relationship,did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
test,relationship,"I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything ."
test,relationship,"Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?"
test,relationship,"yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous ."
test,relationship,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
test,relationship,people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
test,relationship,I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
test,relationship,that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
test,relationship,thank goodness we're not rich and famous !

test,relationship,did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
test,relationship,why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
test,relationship,"well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers ."
test,relationship,do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
test,relationship,"no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions ."
test,relationship,it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
test,relationship,"religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal ."
test,relationship,what do you think about abortion ?
test,relationship,"I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself ."
test,relationship,do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
test,relationship,"I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children ."
test,relationship,"why not ? It's their children , too ."
test,relationship,"that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand ."
test,relationship,"that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter ."
test,ordinary_life,"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments ."
test,ordinary_life,But I don't have any reading assignments .

test,ordinary_life,"Aw , Mom-you're such a drag ."
test,ordinary_life,"You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best ."

test,ordinary_life,It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
test,ordinary_life,I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
test,ordinary_life,That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
test,ordinary_life,Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
test,ordinary_life,I would be happy to look at apartments with you .

test,ordinary_life,How silly of you to jump out of the window !
test,ordinary_life,But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !
test,ordinary_life,Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
test,ordinary_life,That would be too late .
test,ordinary_life,Maybe the situation is too urgent .
test,ordinary_life,"Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case ."
test,ordinary_life,I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .
test,ordinary_life,I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .

test,ordinary_life,"I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken ."
test,ordinary_life,Those are the only things you eat ?
test,ordinary_life,That's basically what I eat .
test,ordinary_life,Why aren't you eating anything else ?
test,ordinary_life,"Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy ."
test,ordinary_life,And the chicken ?
test,ordinary_life,It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
test,ordinary_life,I guess that does sound a lot healthier .

test,relationship,The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
test,relationship,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
test,relationship,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
test,relationship,Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
test,relationship,I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
test,relationship,Do you have anything to do after this ?

test,relationship,"Yeah , a number of times ."
test,relationship,What's he trying to pull anyway .
test,relationship,I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
test,relationship,Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
test,relationship,"You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy ."
test,relationship,I can't believe how hot it is .
test,relationship,It's not even noon yet .
test,relationship,That means it will get hotter .
test,relationship,I am dying from the heat .

test,relationship,"Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright ."
test,relationship,"But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up !"
test,relationship,"You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ' m sure he ' ll forgive you ..."

test,relationship,"Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?"
test,relationship,"Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat ."
test,relationship,That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
test,relationship,"It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy ."
test,relationship,I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
test,relationship,"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late ."

test,relationship,"What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?"
test,relationship,"That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !"
test,relationship,"So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?"
test,relationship,"Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry ."
test,relationship,"Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me ."
test,relationship,"I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do ."

test,attitude_and_emotion,I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .
test,attitude_and_emotion,You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
test,attitude_and_emotion,That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .
test,attitude_and_emotion,How about a training course ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,A training course ? That must be costly .
test,attitude_and_emotion,But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"OK , let's have a try ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,OK .
test,relationship,Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?

test,relationship,"You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it ."
test,relationship,"I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened ."
test,relationship,"In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software ."
test,relationship,Can you recommend some to me ?

test,culture_and_educastion,He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
test,culture_and_educastion,"But , you were born and raised in California !"
test,culture_and_educastion,"Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes ."
test,culture_and_educastion,What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
test,culture_and_educastion,"You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice ."
test,culture_and_educastion,"So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?"
test,culture_and_educastion,"I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it ."
test,culture_and_educastion,Are you sure he really got the message ?
test,culture_and_educastion,"Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English ."
test,culture_and_educastion,That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
test,culture_and_educastion,"He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good ."
test,culture_and_educastion,I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .

test,relationship,we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
test,relationship,I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
test,relationship,It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
test,culture_and_educastion,I give up ! I simply can't learn French !
test,culture_and_educastion,Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .
test,culture_and_educastion,"No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well ."
test,culture_and_educastion,Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
test,culture_and_educastion,Good idea . That might help .
test,relationship,He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means .

test,relationship,How old are your children ?
test,relationship,I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .

test,relationship,were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
test,relationship,"I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood ."

test,school_life,"I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea ."

test,school_life,My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
test,school_life,That's pretty cool .

test,relationship,I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
test,relationship,"I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation ."
test,relationship,It must have really hurt afterwards .
test,relationship,"Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing ."
test,relationship,I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
test,relationship,"I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !"
test,relationship,Is there any pain now ?
test,relationship,"No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days ."
test,relationship,Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?

test,relationship,How was the party ?
test,relationship,I had a fantastic time .
test,relationship,"Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?"
test,relationship,"Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job ."
test,relationship,Why ? You ' re not satisfied anymore ?
test,relationship,"I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out ."
test,relationship,That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .

test,attitude_and_emotion,Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yeah , I'm afraid so ."

test,relationship,"Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me ."
test,relationship,What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
test,relationship,"Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful ."
test,relationship,"That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day ."
test,relationship,But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
test,relationship,"Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?"

test,relationship,Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .
test,relationship,I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .
test,relationship,"Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad ."
test,relationship,"Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it ."
test,relationship,What do you think about violence in movies ?
test,relationship,"Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch ."

test,relationship,"If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun ."
test,relationship,Are you free tomorrow night ?

test,relationship,If only our company prescribe flex time .
test,relationship,The board has been considering introducing flex time .

test,relationship,"He ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?"
test,relationship,"He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age ."
test,relationship,Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
test,relationship,The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
test,relationship,How are they at swimming ?
test,relationship,"They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape ."
test,relationship,Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
test,relationship,I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
test,relationship,"I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher ."

test,relationship,"Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day ."

test,relationship,"Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ..."
test,relationship,Is everything ready now ?
test,relationship,"Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive ."
test,relationship,Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
test,relationship,"Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet ."
test,relationship,"It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive ."
test,relationship,That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
test,relationship,I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
test,relationship,Thank you .
test,relationship,My pleasure .
test,relationship,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?

test,relationship,You know you didn't .

test,relationship,"Oh , you men ! You're all the same ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?"

test,relationship,I'm afraid not .
test,relationship,"Good afternoon , Johnson ."
test,relationship,"Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?"
test,relationship,"Not bad , thanks ."
test,relationship,I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
test,relationship,God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
test,relationship,"Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day ."
test,relationship,They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
test,relationship,I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
test,relationship,You'd better pay more attention to your health .
test,relationship,"I will , thanks for your concern ."
test,relationship,You're welcome .
test,relationship,It is too bad today .
test,relationship,What happened ?
test,relationship,"My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it ."
test,relationship,How did you find him at last ?
test,relationship,It was the police wo helped me to do that .
test,relationship,It must have taught you a lesson this time .
test,relationship,I want to give our kitchen the works .
test,relationship,Why ? I think it ' s convenient and good .
test,relationship,No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ' s modern .
test,relationship,Why should we run after the fashion ?
test,relationship,I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,I'm crazy about it . It makes me very excited .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Then tell me what's good about it .
test,attitude_and_emotion,It can't be expressed by words .
test,relationship,What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .
test,relationship,I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .
test,work,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one ."
test,work,"Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal ."
test,work,"Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations ."
test,work,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner ."
test,relationship,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
test,relationship,What ? Why do we have to do that ?
test,relationship,"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour ."
test,relationship,"I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !"
test,relationship,"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !"
test,relationship,"That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !"
test,relationship,I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I ' d love to . it ' s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good ."

test,relationship,Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?

test,relationship,You ' re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ' s you favourite award category ?
test,relationship,"You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film ."
test,relationship,It ' s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .
test,relationship,How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?
test,relationship,We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .
test,relationship,Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .
test,relationship,But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .
test,relationship,How do you celebrate national day in your country ?
test,relationship,There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .

test,relationship,"The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?"
test,relationship,We don ' t have a national day .
test,relationship,Really ? That ' s unusual .
test,relationship,"I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t ."

test,relationship,Not great . It's a kind of boring .
test,relationship,Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
test,relationship,"Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed ."
test,relationship,"What happened , John ?"
test,relationship,Nothing .
test,relationship,Why do you look unhappy ?
test,relationship,I ' m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .

test,relationship,I hope so .
test,school_life,You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .

test,relationship,"As a matter of fact , he gave me this address ."
test,relationship,Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"But not as good as your mother's , right ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Actually , it's better ..."
test,attitude_and_emotion,What ? Are you kidding ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ..."

test,relationship,"No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?"

test,relationship,Mary and Tom are breaking up .
test,relationship,It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?
test,relationship,"Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman ."
test,relationship,Do you think they'll become reconciled ?
test,relationship,"No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage ."
test,relationship,What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .
test,relationship,have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?
test,relationship,sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
test,relationship,"as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?"
test,relationship,"to begin with , I have to use chopsticks ."
test,relationship,but you look quite proficient in using them now .
test,relationship,"certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch"
test,relationship,"yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i"
test,relationship,anything strang about that ?
test,relationship,"maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present ."
test,relationship,"oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I can't forget it .
test,attitude_and_emotion,You'd better cool yourself down first .
test,school_life,"Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it ."

test,school_life,"Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department ."
test,school_life,"Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will ."
test,relationship,I hate to go outside .

test,relationship,Why do you hate to go outside ?
test,relationship,I meet too many jerks .
test,relationship,I agree .
test,relationship,This city is full of jerks .
test,relationship,Rude people are everywhere .
test,relationship,But what can you do ?

test,school_life,I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .
test,school_life,What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?
test,school_life,I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
test,school_life,I can't agree more .
test,relationship,Why don't you watch where you're going ?
test,relationship,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
test,relationship,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
test,relationship,"Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me ."
test,relationship,I think my arm is broken .
test,relationship,"Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too ."
test,relationship,"Listen , let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was ."
test,relationship,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
test,relationship,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?"
test,relationship,Alright .
test,relationship,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
test,relationship,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital ."
test,relationship,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
test,relationship,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time ."
test,relationship,It really hurts .
test,relationship,"Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?"
test,relationship,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
test,relationship,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?"
test,relationship,To hell with you .
test,relationship,"Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?"
test,relationship,Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?

test,relationship,"That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning ."
test,relationship,I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
test,relationship,Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
test,relationship,The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .
test,relationship,And ?
test,relationship,And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
test,relationship,Poor child !
test,school_life,Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?
test,school_life,What's your excuse this time ?
test,school_life,Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
test,school_life,"Yes , twice last week ."
test,school_life,Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
test,school_life,I don't think so . But it could've been .
test,school_life,Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
test,school_life,"I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?"
test,school_life,I'll do my best .

test,school_life,I'm working on it . Really !
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Hi , Becky , what's up ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,What's the problem ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
test,attitude_and_emotion,For example ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun ."

test,attitude_and_emotion,He must be green . It ' s lucky that we will get off soon .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I feel eggplants are more nutritious .

test,relationship,That way they look longer .
test,relationship,Now what are you doing ?

test,relationship,What did he say ?
test,relationship,He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
test,relationship,"It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man ."
test,relationship,"Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know ."
test,relationship,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . oh , there he is ."
test,relationship,"hey , Isabelle ..."

test,attitude_and_emotion,"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , that's all right ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that ."
test,school_life,May I ask a question ?
test,school_life,"Yes , what's it ?"
test,school_life,What does mph stand for ?

test,relationship,Then we'd better not go .
test,relationship,OK .
test,relationship,Are you ready to go shopping ?
test,relationship,Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
test,relationship,What research ?
test,relationship,Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
test,relationship,But they're just ads .
test,relationship,"Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ."
test,relationship,Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
test,relationship,I think there ' s a Western on .

test,culture_and_educastion,I'll take home economics .
test,culture_and_educastion,Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
test,relationship,"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts ."
test,relationship,But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .
test,relationship,What do you mean ?
test,relationship,"They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets ."
test,relationship,That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
test,relationship,"Ann , do you have time next Monday ?"

test,relationship,"Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party ."

test,attitude_and_emotion,How about your husband . Does he help much ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,That sucks .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,That's crossing the line .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?

test,relationship,"I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?"
test,relationship,"Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it ."
test,relationship,Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .

test,relationship,How do you arrange this summer vacation ?
test,relationship,I want to travel .
test,relationship,Where would you like to go ?
test,relationship,The seaside .
test,relationship,That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .
test,relationship,"I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good ."
test,relationship,"Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really ."
test,relationship,Thank you !
test,relationship,"Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ?"
test,relationship,"No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now ."

test,relationship,"I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there ."
test,relationship,And English is very useful in your job .
test,relationship,"I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life ."
test,relationship,You will be a very promising one .
test,relationship,That ' s my wish .
test,relationship,I hear you are expecting your family .
test,relationship,"Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well ."
test,relationship,I didn't know you had a brother .
test,relationship,"Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often ."
test,relationship,"Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?"
test,relationship,His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
test,relationship,Does your brother have just one son ?
test,relationship,"No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them ."
test,relationship,I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
test,relationship,"Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it ."
test,relationship,So when are they all coming ?
test,relationship,My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .
test,relationship,You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?
test,relationship,I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
test,relationship,Where did you spend your holiday ?
test,relationship,I went to Paris .
test,relationship,"So , Paula , where are you from ?"
test,relationship,"I'm from Canada , originally ."
test,relationship,From Canada ? Where were you born ?
test,relationship,Montreal .
test,relationship,When did you come to Los Angeles ?
test,relationship,We moved here when I was fourteen .
test,relationship,Did you go to school here ?
test,relationship,"Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas ."
test,relationship,Did you get a job right after graduation ?
test,relationship,"No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France ."
test,relationship,When was that ?
test,relationship,Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
test,relationship,I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
test,relationship,I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
test,relationship,Do you consider yourself a good mother ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman ."
test,relationship,"How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother ."
test,relationship,"I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself ."
test,relationship,Does your husband feel the same ?
test,relationship,Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
test,relationship,"I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth ."
test,relationship,"let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance ."
test,relationship,"I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people ."
test,relationship,"you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion ."
test,relationship,I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .
test,relationship,we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
test,relationship,that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
test,relationship,that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
test,relationship,I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
test,relationship,"the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how ."
test,relationship,What's his job ?
test,relationship,He used to be a policeman .
test,relationship,But Mrs . Smith hired him to find her lost son .
test,relationship,Yeah . He's a private eye now .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Bother the flies !
test,attitude_and_emotion,Where do they come from ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,I don't know . Something rotten here ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,I can't see it .
test,relationship,Have you got your invitation yet ?
test,relationship,"My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?"
test,relationship,The house warming party .
test,relationship,Whose house warming party is it ?
test,relationship,Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
test,relationship,"Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately ."
test,relationship,It's out in the suburbs .
test,relationship,Have you seen the house ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend ."
test,relationship,Is it nice ?
test,relationship,"Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen ."
test,relationship,There's also a garden .
test,relationship,"Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?"
test,relationship,"They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight ."
test,relationship,When are they going to have the party ?
test,relationship,Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
test,relationship,"Wow , that would be something to look forward to ."
test,relationship,"hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?"
test,relationship,I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
test,relationship,"oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?"
test,relationship,"we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec"
test,relationship,wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
test,relationship,tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
test,relationship,"perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank ."
test,relationship,"no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know ."
test,relationship,"we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning ."
test,relationship,"great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain ."
test,relationship,no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
test,relationship,"Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us ."
test,relationship,"Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink ."
test,relationship,Sounds good . Where are we going ?
test,relationship,Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
test,relationship,"Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?"
test,relationship,"Yeah , I broke up with Lisa . She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !"
test,relationship,Whew ! That getup is terrific !
test,relationship,Never mind the getup . She ' s beautiful !
test,relationship,That too .
test,relationship,I'm gonna introduce myself .
test,relationship,"If you're lucky , that might do the trick ."
test,relationship,"Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here ."
test,relationship,Hold on ! What's the big hurry ?
test,relationship,"My ex-girlfriend's here . If she sees me , my goose is cooked ."
test,relationship,I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .
test,relationship,"OK , catch you later ."
test,relationship,Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ' s been such a long time !
test,relationship,"Darlene ! Indeed , it ' s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ' Ve done with your hair !"
test,relationship,"Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ' t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !"
test,relationship,"Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ' Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !"
test,relationship,"Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know ."
test,relationship,He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !
test,relationship,"Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently ."
test,relationship,Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .
test,relationship,Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
test,relationship,"But of course ! Well , it ' s been great talking to you , but I have to get going ."
test,relationship,"Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !"
test,relationship,That would be great ! Give me a call !
test,relationship,See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ' t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
test,school_life,Did you already take the history exam ?
test,school_life,Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
test,school_life,I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?
test,school_life,Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .
test,school_life,What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?
test,school_life,I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
test,school_life,"Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class ."
test,school_life,"If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go ."
test,school_life,Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .
test,school_life,Good luck .
test,school_life,Thanks . See ya .
test,relationship,"What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable ."
test,relationship,It's us .
test,relationship,"What do you mean by "" us "" ?"
test,relationship,"Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?"
test,relationship,"What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?"
test,relationship,"Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together ."
test,relationship,Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
test,relationship,Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
test,relationship,"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?"
test,relationship,Yes . Do you like it ?
test,relationship,It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
test,relationship,Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
test,relationship,Is classical music your favorite ?
test,relationship,Yes . What about you ?
test,relationship,I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
test,relationship,Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
test,relationship,"Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it ."
test,relationship,Did you always like pop music .
test,relationship,"I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music ."
test,relationship,I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
test,relationship,"oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play ."
test,relationship,"Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy ."
test,relationship,It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .
test,relationship,Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?
test,relationship,Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
test,relationship,"Fortunately , things are changing these years ."
test,relationship,"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon ."
test,relationship,"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?"
test,relationship,"There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me ."
test,relationship,I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .
test,relationship,What about sunday ?
test,relationship,"i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday ."
test,relationship,Maybe next week .
test,relationship,"Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work ."
test,relationship,"Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat ."
test,relationship,"I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime ."
test,relationship,"Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?"
test,relationship,"Yeah , I ' m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains ."
test,relationship,"Oh , do you go hiking often ?"
test,relationship,I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
test,relationship,It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
test,relationship,"Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?"
test,relationship,"Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike ."
test,relationship,Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
test,relationship,"Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest ."
test,relationship,"Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend ."
test,relationship,"Thanks , I ' ll ask him ."
test,relationship,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
test,relationship,I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
test,relationship,I have reported it to the police .
test,relationship,We'd better prepare for the worst .
test,relationship,"You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?"
test,relationship,"He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?"
test,relationship,I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
test,relationship,I can think of better things to dream about ...
test,relationship,"Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away ."
test,relationship,That's crazy .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Mike ! Look at the floor !
test,attitude_and_emotion,What's wrong with it ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
test,attitude_and_emotion,Oh ...
test,attitude_and_emotion,It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Sorry , love ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,What are you looking for now ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,My cigarettes .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
test,relationship,Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad ."
test,relationship,It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .
test,relationship,Are you Chinese by birth ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations ."
test,relationship,How do you like it ?
test,relationship,I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
test,relationship,I want to study Mandarin and public relations .
test,relationship,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look ."
test,relationship,Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
test,relationship,Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
test,relationship,Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
test,relationship,You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?
test,relationship,They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
test,relationship,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?"
test,relationship,"Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine ."
test,relationship,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
test,relationship,It's possible .
test,relationship,You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .
test,relationship,"Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !"
test,relationship,"Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !"
test,relationship,How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?
test,relationship,Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
test,relationship,Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !
test,relationship,"The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five ."
test,relationship,What are we waiting for ? Let's go !
test,relationship,Let ' s play a game !
test,relationship,OK ! How about Scrabble ?
test,relationship,"No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ' m going to describe someone ' s face , and you guess who it is !"
test,relationship,OK !
test,relationship,"Let ' s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !"
test,relationship,"Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !"
test,relationship,"Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !"
test,relationship,Your future husband !
test,relationship,Not funny .
test,relationship,"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives ."
test,relationship,"It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points ."
test,relationship,Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
test,relationship,"For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study ."
test,relationship,That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
test,relationship,"Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them ."
test,relationship,"Lee , I'm going to get married next month ."
test,relationship,Good news ! And congratulations !
test,relationship,You are invited to my wedding .
test,relationship,Thank you . I'll certainly be there .
test,school_life,Thank you for lending me the book .
test,school_life,"Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow ."
test,school_life,But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
test,relationship,Don ' t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?
test,relationship,I ' m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .
test,relationship,"Don ' t you think in that case , there wouldn ' t be so much stealing ?"
test,relationship,Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .
test,relationship,"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?"
test,relationship,"Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close ."
test,relationship,That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
test,relationship,It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
test,relationship,Yeah . I think I can find it .
test,relationship,You're back already . That sure was quick .
test,relationship,That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
test,relationship,"Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time ."
test,relationship,"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway ."
test,relationship,"Okay , let's go !"
test,relationship,"hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?"
test,relationship,"well , I spend a lot of time watching movies ."
test,relationship,"what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too ."
test,relationship,"oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?"
test,relationship,"actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?"
test,relationship,"art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too ."
test,relationship,really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
test,relationship,sure . I enjoy both of them very much .
test,relationship,how often do you go to the cinema ?
test,relationship,"once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon ."
test,relationship,movie salon ? where is that ?
test,relationship,it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .
test,relationship,is it good ?
test,relationship,"yes , you can find almost all new releases there ."
test,relationship,really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .
test,relationship,why not ?
test,relationship,Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !
test,relationship,Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .
test,relationship,Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
test,relationship,That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
test,relationship,Three months .
test,relationship,Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
test,relationship,"I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way ."
test,relationship,Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
test,relationship,I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
test,relationship,There are so many things you have to prepare for .
test,relationship,"I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time ."
test,relationship,It really must be an exciting time for you guys .
test,relationship,Thank you so much .
test,relationship,Mary seems depressed . What ' s the matter ?
test,relationship,She didn ' t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ' s hard work .
test,relationship,Poor girl !
test,relationship,"Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide ."
test,relationship,Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?
test,relationship,"That's what I'm wondering , too ."
test,relationship,I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
test,relationship,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
test,relationship,"Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then ."
test,relationship,"We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?"
test,relationship,"Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time ."
test,relationship,What a pity ! You can't join us .
test,relationship,"So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway ."
test,relationship,"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?"
test,relationship,Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .
test,relationship,"Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?"
test,relationship,I prefer sea food .
test,relationship,ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
test,relationship,That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
test,relationship,See you later .
test,relationship,bye .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"If that happen to me , I ' ll take them back to the shop ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,I did . But they said they won ' t change them .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do ."
test,work,Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
test,work,Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
test,work,Totally agree . What is your solution ?
test,work,"Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy ."
test,work,You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
test,work,It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
test,work,"But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses ."
test,work,"I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team ."
test,relationship,I am so busy today .
test,relationship,Can I help you ?
test,relationship,I ' m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .
test,relationship,I ' ll be glad to help .
test,relationship,Or maybe make the beds .
test,relationship,All you have to do is ask for help .
test,relationship,Thanks . That ' s terrific !
test,relationship,I ' m ready and willing to help .
test,relationship,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening ."
test,relationship,Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
test,relationship,Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
test,relationship,Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
test,relationship,"I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves ."
test,relationship,You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
test,relationship,You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .
test,relationship,I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
test,relationship,Do you feel ok ?
test,relationship,"Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu ."
test,relationship,Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
test,relationship,Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
test,relationship,You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
test,relationship,"Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting ."
test,relationship,"Zach , what's that on your arm ?"
test,relationship,"I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing ."
test,relationship,It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
test,relationship,"Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks ."
test,relationship,I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
test,relationship,Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
test,relationship,"We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse ."
test,relationship,Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
test,relationship,I can't go to your party .
test,relationship,That's too bad .
test,relationship,Do you like being a doctor ?
test,relationship,"Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult ."
test,relationship,Can you tell me about it ?
test,relationship,"You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not ."
test,relationship,What can you do when this happens ?
test,relationship,"Not much , usually I'll just keep silent ."
test,relationship,Have you eaten ?
test,relationship,Not yet .
test,relationship,It's too hot to read .
test,relationship,We'd better go out for a walk .
test,relationship,Which season do you like best ?
test,relationship,Spring .
test,relationship,How about summer ?
test,relationship,I dislike it most .
test,relationship,Why ?
test,relationship,Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
test,relationship,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
test,relationship,My son came home from three years in the navy .
test,relationship,It was a real red letter day for you .
test,relationship,Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
test,relationship,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?"
test,relationship,"Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?"
test,relationship,"It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day ."
test,relationship,"You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?"
test,relationship,I must be going .
test,relationship,Okay . Keep in touch .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"I ' m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"I don ' t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I know why we have reservations .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"I don ' t think you do . If you did , I ' d have a car . See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Fine . I ' ll take the compact .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car ."
test,relationship,Do you think Tom will be elected president ?
test,relationship,"No , I think Harry will get it ."
test,relationship,Let's make a bet on who gets it .
test,relationship,"OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night ."
test,work,I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .
test,work,"Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer ."
test,work,"You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ?"
test,work,"To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression ."
test,work,"But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ' re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive ."
test,relationship,What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
test,relationship,Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
test,relationship,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
test,relationship,"If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won ."
test,relationship,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
test,relationship,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
test,relationship,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
test,relationship,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
test,relationship,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
test,relationship,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !"
test,relationship,"Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs ."
test,relationship,"I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs ."
test,relationship,Let's hope so .
test,relationship,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?"
test,relationship,That's because Americans love sitcoms .
test,relationship,Sitcoms ?
test,relationship,"Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values ."
test,relationship,"In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies ."
test,relationship,I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
test,relationship,Are you interested in history ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks ."
test,relationship,"I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened ."
test,relationship,I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
test,relationship,Some people say that history repeats itself .
test,relationship,"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?"
test,relationship,"The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same ."
test,relationship,I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
test,attitude_and_emotion,You're looking great .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"You , too ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yes , they say I would get a big sum ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Have you discussed it with your wife ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yes , she leaves it to me ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I have to think about it .
test,relationship,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?
test,relationship,"Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L ."
test,relationship,Of course .
test,relationship,I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0 . 1 of a second .
test,relationship,That ' s great . He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season . I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics .
test,relationship,I think you ' re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ' ll win ?
test,relationship,"I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones ."
test,relationship,What do you think our chance are in other events .
test,relationship,"In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events ."
test,relationship,We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
test,relationship,I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
test,relationship,You are very optimistic !
test,relationship,"Helen , did you hear I ' m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place ."
test,relationship,"I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me ."
test,relationship,"Well , drop by if you can ."
test,relationship,"I will , do you want me to bring anything ?"
test,relationship,"No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there ."
test,relationship,It's said that John's broken up .
test,relationship,Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
test,relationship,I hear that John's leading a double wife .
test,relationship,It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
test,relationship,Let's play chess .
test,relationship,I haven't played chess for a long time .
test,relationship,"That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play ."
test,relationship,"Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing ."

test,relationship,"Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere ."
test,relationship,"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation ."
test,relationship,A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
test,relationship,I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
test,relationship,"Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us ."
test,relationship,"Yes , absolutely true ."

test,attitude_and_emotion,Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
test,attitude_and_emotion,What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !"
test,attitude_and_emotion,So he talks about you behind your back ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
test,attitude_and_emotion,I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !"
test,attitude_and_emotion,What is it ? What happened ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,I think someone is stalking me .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,What did you do ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Did he leave when you left ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
test,attitude_and_emotion,What did you do ?
test,school_life,"Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?"

test,school_life,"OK , I'd love the company ."
test,school_life,This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
test,relationship,have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
test,relationship,"when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which -- is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?"
test,relationship,"the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland ."
test,relationship,that's right . Why do you ask ?
test,relationship,"well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon ."
test,relationship,when are you getting married ?

test,relationship,even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
test,relationship,"even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun ."

test,relationship,"No , what ?"
test,relationship,He's got a promotion .
test,relationship,You're kidding .
test,relationship,"No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells ."
test,relationship,I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
test,relationship,"Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul ."
test,relationship,Well . Good for him .
test,relationship,"Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?"
test,relationship,I think the supermarket is closed now .
test,relationship,"Oh , When does it close ?"
test,relationship,It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .

test,relationship,Who's that ?
test,relationship,Search me .
test,relationship,I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ' s not still mad at me .
test,relationship,What did you argue about ?
test,relationship,He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ' t have the money yet .
test,relationship,"Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair ."
test,relationship,"Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry ."
test,relationship,Did you lend him a lot of money ?
test,relationship,"Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back ."
test,relationship,"Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?"
test,relationship,"No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up ."
test,relationship,"Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?"
test,relationship,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
test,relationship,I don ' t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
test,relationship,Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
test,relationship,"No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres ."
test,relationship,Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?
test,relationship,Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
test,relationship,They must be amazing animals .
test,relationship,They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .
test,relationship,I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .
test,relationship,They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
test,relationship,"Oh dear , my weight has gone up again ."
test,relationship,"I am not surprised , you eat too much ."
test,relationship,And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
test,relationship,"No , I wouldn't think so ."
test,relationship,I do wish I could lose weight .
test,relationship,"Well , why don't you go on the diet ?"
test,relationship,I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
test,relationship,Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .
test,relationship,"Yes , maybe I should ."
test,relationship,Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets
test,relationship,All right .
test,relationship,Here is your ticket .
test,relationship,Thank you .
test,relationship,The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .

test,relationship,I guessed it .
test,relationship,"Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well ."
test,relationship,"Oh , how wonderful !"
test,relationship,I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
test,relationship,"I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers ."
test,relationship,The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
test,relationship,Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .
test,relationship,Don ' t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
test,relationship,Can you ride a horse ?
test,relationship,"Yes , I can . I don ' t ride regularly though . How about you ?"
test,relationship,I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
test,relationship,What a good idea !
test,school_life,Where's Mrs . Johnson ?
test,school_life,"Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner ."

test,school_life,"Okay , Tom ."

test,relationship,Have you heard of Paul ?
test,relationship,"No , what ?"
test,relationship,He's got a promotion .
test,relationship,You're kidding .
test,relationship,"No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells ."
test,relationship,"Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years ."
test,relationship,"Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul ."
test,relationship,Well . Good for him .

test,school_life,"Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look ."
test,school_life,"OK , let's go ."
test,school_life,"The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here ."
test,school_life,"Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead ."
test,school_life,Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck .
test,school_life,"Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce ."
test,school_life,"Wow , Bruce crossed the line first ."
test,relationship,Tim ' s smiles are interesting .
test,relationship,"Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful ."
test,relationship,You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
test,relationship,How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
test,relationship,Have you enjoyed your weekend ?
test,relationship,"Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble ."
test,relationship,Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
test,relationship,The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
test,relationship,It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .
test,relationship,Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
test,relationship,That's true .
test,relationship,I ' m forming a music band .
test,relationship,Do you already know how to play an instrument ?

test,relationship,"Yes , I ' m a singer ."

test,relationship,I would like to have that new style Gl Joe .
test,relationship,Have you asked Santa ?
test,relationship,Yes and I've written him a letter .
test,relationship,"Lili , let ' s take a vacation !"

test,relationship,"Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ' t cost much ."
test,relationship,"Where will we sleep , then ?"
test,relationship,In the van .
test,relationship,What about other expenses ?
test,relationship,"Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?"
test,relationship,Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
test,relationship,The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
test,relationship,"Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet ."

test,relationship,How was your business trip ?
test,relationship,Great - they wined and dined us all week .
test,relationship,Nice to meet you here . How come you dropped into this company today ?

test,relationship,So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
test,relationship,"That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !"
test,relationship,Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
test,relationship,"Well , no , it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?"
test,relationship,"You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc ."
test,relationship,"Well , that seems easy enough ."
test,relationship,"Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea ."
test,relationship,Geez . Is that all ?
test,relationship,"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !"
test,relationship,Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
test,relationship,I hear that Mary got mad .
test,relationship,So I heard .
test,relationship,What ' s wrong with her ?
test,relationship,She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
test,relationship,"Um , what will you do this weekend ?"
test,relationship,How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .
test,relationship,A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
test,relationship,No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
test,relationship,"Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too ."
test,relationship,What ' s on TV tonight ?
test,relationship,"Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel ."

test,relationship,No it ' s not . It ' s just funny .
test,relationship,"Yeah , if you ' re a girl ."
test,relationship,"Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl ."
test,relationship,That ' s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .
test,relationship,It ' s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
test,relationship,"O . K . , O . K . Let ' s forget it . There ' s a football game on too ."
test,relationship,No way . I ' m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ' s to watch the game .
test,attitude_and_emotion,It ' s really terrible !
test,attitude_and_emotion,What are you talking about ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,Don ' t you see many parents are forcing there children ' s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .
test,attitude_and_emotion,You said it . Many parents just don ' t know how to educate their children .
test,relationship,"Sarah , what did you do today ?"

test,relationship,At the mall on 5th street .
test,relationship,Was it expensive ?
test,relationship,"No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars ."
test,relationship,That's cheap .
test,relationship,I know . It was a really good deal .
test,relationship,I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
test,relationship,"Hi , Victor . How are you ?"
test,relationship,"Oh , I'm fine ."
test,relationship,"So , are you going to go to class tonight ?"
test,relationship,Maybe ... but I don't think so .
test,relationship,Really ? What's the matter ?
test,relationship,I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
test,relationship,"Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner ."
test,relationship,"Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already ."
test,relationship,How's John doing ?
test,relationship,He can barely make ends meet .
test,relationship,The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .

test,relationship,It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
test,relationship,How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
test,relationship,I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
test,relationship,Is it really worth paying for ?
test,relationship,I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
test,relationship,"If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition ."
test,relationship,"Come on , you are left behind !"
test,relationship,"Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey ."
test,relationship,You just need more exercise .
test,relationship,"Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !"
test,relationship,I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
test,relationship,But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
test,relationship,Why ?
test,relationship,We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
test,relationship,But I want to burn up more calories !
test,relationship,"In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time ."
test,relationship,Really ? I will slow down then .
test,relationship,"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?"
test,relationship,"Fine , thank you . I haven ' t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?"
test,relationship,"I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films ."
test,relationship,"Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary ."
test,relationship,"Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them ."
test,relationship,"It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one ."
test,relationship,But it's really exciting .
test,relationship,"Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one ."
test,relationship,Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
test,relationship,Yep .
test,relationship,I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
test,relationship,"Maybe . After all , I am grown up now ."
test,relationship,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession ."
test,relationship,The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .
test,relationship,"Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost ."
test,relationship,"It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy ."
test,relationship,Are you an art aficionado ?
test,relationship,"Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ?"
test,relationship,"I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art ."
test,relationship,I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school .
test,relationship,Art isn ' t for everyone . I ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ' s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
test,relationship,"I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you ."
test,relationship,I thought I ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
test,relationship,That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
test,relationship,Let ' s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
test,relationship,"What does your mother do , may I ask ?"
test,relationship,My mother works in a company as an accountant .
test,relationship,Is she busy ?
test,relationship,"Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year ."
test,relationship,"Hello , Bessie ."
test,relationship,"Hello , Jack . Happy birthday !"
test,relationship,"My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday ."
test,relationship,"I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them ."
test,relationship,Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .
test,relationship,"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you ."
test,relationship,Thank you very much .
test,relationship,"Nice day , isn't it ?"
test,relationship,It sure is .
test,relationship,It's a good day for a picnic .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,I don't want to .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Well , come over and talk to me then ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Certainly not .
test,attitude_and_emotion,May I turn on the TV then ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,Turn on the TV for what ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it ."
test,relationship,Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !
test,relationship,Brian ! How have you been ?
test,relationship,"Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !"
test,relationship,"Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before ."
test,relationship,"Well , you look great ! How are you ?"
test,relationship,I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .
test,relationship,That's terrific !
test,school_life,How is your new dormitory ?
test,school_life,"It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly ."
test,school_life,"Well , do you all major in the same subject ?"
test,school_life,"No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating ."
test,school_life,That's great !
test,relationship,"Peter , how often do you exercise ?"
test,relationship,"Well , I swim and run every day ."
test,relationship,"Now , tell me , what do you eat ?"
test,relationship,"Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs ."
test,relationship,Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
test,relationship,"Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit ."
test,relationship,What do you drink ?
test,relationship,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you ."
test,relationship,What ' s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?
test,relationship,We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .
test,relationship,How hard is the climb ?
test,relationship,It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
test,relationship,What did you do last week ?
test,relationship,We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .
test,relationship,Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ' m sorry I missed it .
test,relationship,"Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb ."
test,relationship,"Yeah , I will . See you then !"
test,relationship,O . K . See you .
test,relationship,How many languages can you speak ?
test,relationship,I can speak French and German .
test,relationship,How well can you speak them ?
test,relationship,"I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well ."
test,relationship,Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
test,relationship,"No , but I'll be able to tomorrow ."
test,relationship,Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?
test,relationship,Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
test,relationship,It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
test,relationship,You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .
test,relationship,"Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !"
test,relationship,It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
test,relationship,Do you really have to work today ?
test,relationship,Yes . I'm afraid so .
test,relationship,But you'll miss out on the football game .
test,relationship,"Oh . Well , it can't be helped ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , do you really think so ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Of course , otherwise you ' ll just have to wait for hours ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight .
test,relationship,I had an accident .
test,relationship,That's terrible !
test,relationship,"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last ."
test,relationship,You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,Come on ! You're pulling my leg .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Really ! Here's my trophy .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Wow ! Congratulations !
test,relationship,What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
test,relationship,Thank you .
test,relationship,Is that your wedding ring ?
test,relationship,I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
test,relationship,"Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?"
test,relationship,In June .
test,relationship,Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
test,relationship,"Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch ."
test,relationship,You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
test,relationship,Thank you so much .
test,relationship,What kind of watch is it ?
test,relationship,It's a Tag Heer .
test,relationship,"If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?"
test,relationship,This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
test,relationship,That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
test,relationship,Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
test,relationship,I'm really mad at Bob .
test,relationship,What for ? ( Why ? )
test,relationship,"Hi , Jack , how have you been ?"
test,relationship,Not very well .
test,relationship,Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
test,relationship,Nothing .
test,relationship,"Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter ."
test,relationship,"Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane ."
test,relationship,"Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher ."
test,relationship,"Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young ."
test,relationship,"Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family ."
test,relationship,Maybe you're right .
test,relationship,"Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !"
test,relationship,"Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ..."
test,relationship,Do you know Sally ?
test,relationship,Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .
test,relationship,Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .
test,relationship,"Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career ."
test,relationship,Excuse me . Do you have the time ?
test,relationship,"My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think ."
test,relationship,"Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?"
test,relationship,"If we start now , we can make it by taxi ."
test,relationship,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
test,relationship,Yeah .
test,relationship,Who won ?

test,relationship,"What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in ."
test,relationship,The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .

test,relationship,Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
test,relationship,"First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story ."
test,relationship,That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
test,relationship,How do you research your books ?
test,relationship,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
test,relationship,I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
test,relationship,Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
test,relationship,Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?

test,relationship,I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
test,relationship,That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
test,relationship,Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
test,relationship,Will it be an all day event ?
test,relationship,Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
test,relationship,That was quick thinking .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I'm so glad I bought this watch !
test,attitude_and_emotion,Cool ! Flashy red lines !
test,attitude_and_emotion,I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
test,attitude_and_emotion,Is it waterproof ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Well , surfing , scuba diving ..."
test,relationship,Do you take a bus to and from work ?
test,relationship,"Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction ."
test,relationship,"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded ."
test,relationship,"Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt ."
test,relationship,"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus ."
test,relationship,What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
test,relationship,"You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !"
test,relationship,"Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?"
test,relationship,"Yeah , absolutely !"
test,relationship,"And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her ."
test,relationship,"You were so happy , weren ' t you ?"
test,relationship,What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .
test,relationship,We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
test,relationship,That's great .
test,relationship,Now let's get things ready .
test,relationship,Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
test,relationship,That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
test,relationship,"Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements ."
test,relationship,"Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice ."
test,relationship,And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
test,relationship,"Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together ."
test,relationship,There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
test,relationship,"That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games ."
test,relationship,"Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you ."
test,relationship,"My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you ."
test,relationship,"OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool ."
test,relationship,"Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .
test,attitude_and_emotion,The boy is good for nothing .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"As a teacher , I don ' t know how to help him ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,He is hopeless .
test,relationship,"Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?"
test,relationship,"Not bad . We have had a big meeting today , remember ?"
test,relationship,"Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?"
test,relationship,Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
test,relationship,"Great , so what happens now ?"
test,relationship,"Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it ."
test,relationship,Do you believe in UFOs ?
test,relationship,"Of course , they are out there ."
test,relationship,But I never saw them .
test,relationship,"Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them ."
test,relationship,You mean that you can them .
test,relationship,That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
test,relationship,They come to the earth ?
test,relationship,No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
test,relationship,Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
test,relationship,"OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings ."
test,relationship,That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
test,relationship,"Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too ."
test,relationship,Wow . Sounds fantastic !
test,relationship,"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?"
test,relationship,Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest .
test,relationship,Really ? Congratulations !
test,relationship,"Thank you , Paul ."
test,relationship,"By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday ."
test,relationship,"Good , happy birthday to you !"
test,relationship,"Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?"
test,relationship,"Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me ."
test,relationship,My pleasure .
test,relationship,Do you have a minute ?
test,relationship,Sure . What's up ?
test,relationship,"Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?"
test,relationship,"Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch ."
test,relationship,"May , I really regret watching it with you last night ."
test,relationship,Did it scare you ?
test,relationship,Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .
test,relationship,"Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time ."
test,relationship,"Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary ."
test,relationship,I like scary movies .
test,relationship,That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !
test,relationship,Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
test,relationship,Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .

test,relationship,You really are lucky !
test,relationship,"Yeah , I know ."
test,relationship,"Say , what's your favorite sport ?"
test,relationship,Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better .

test,relationship,"Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?"
test,relationship,"Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all ."

test,relationship,"Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?"
test,relationship,"Yes , I have . I was there in April ."
test,relationship,"Paris in the spring , eh ?"
test,relationship,"It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time ."
test,relationship,Just like dear old London !

test,relationship,There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .

test,relationship,You've been through this too ?
test,relationship,"Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups ."
test,relationship,But it hurts too much .
test,relationship,"I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls ."
test,relationship,What if I don't want to find another girl ?
test,relationship,"You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover ."
test,relationship,You're right .
test,relationship,"I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?"

test,attitude_and_emotion,"No , I won ' t hear of it ."
test,relationship,"A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again ."
test,relationship,"Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?"
test,relationship,A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
test,relationship,"Not bad , But she's as busy as before ."
test,relationship,"Whatever we do , we should do it above board ."
test,relationship,You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .
test,relationship,"Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels ."
test,relationship,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !"
test,relationship,"Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?"
test,relationship,"Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it ."
test,relationship,Can't Elvin handle it ?
test,relationship,I think he's got too much on his plate .
test,attitude_and_emotion,This is the best dinner I've ever had .
test,attitude_and_emotion,How about the soup ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,I've never tasted anything better .
test,attitude_and_emotion,How nice of you to say so .
test,relationship,"Hey Nick , what are you up to ?"
test,relationship,"Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?"
test,relationship,Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ' t know man .
test,relationship,"Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ' s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim ."
test,relationship,Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
test,relationship,"Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ' t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ' t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ' t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !"
test,relationship,"Wow , I didn ' t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !"
test,relationship,"The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?"
test,relationship,Let ' s do it !
test,relationship,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ' t seen you for a while ."
test,relationship,I ' m fine . I ' Ve been out of town . I just got back .
test,relationship,Where were you ?
test,relationship,I was in New York for a wedding .
test,relationship,Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?
test,relationship,Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
test,relationship,"Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?"
test,relationship,"Just look around ? Ah , that's boring ."
test,relationship,I'll go myself then .
test,relationship,"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps ."
test,relationship,I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
test,relationship,"come on , nothing can be that bad ."
test,relationship,"but promise me , you'll keep it a secret ."
test,relationship,"ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?"
test,relationship,I've fallen in love with my boss .
test,relationship,really ? Is he married ?
test,relationship,"no , of course not . He is still single ."
test,relationship,then what's your problem ?
test,relationship,I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
test,relationship,"oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip ."
test,relationship,"worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days ."
test,relationship,office romance is very tricky .
test,relationship,it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
test,relationship,"cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine ."
test,relationship,You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?
test,relationship,"Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired ."
test,relationship,With the job ?
test,relationship,"With everything , with everybody , with all this !"
test,relationship,A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
test,relationship,"It wasn't always like this , you know ."
test,relationship,What do you mean ?
test,relationship,"Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives ."
test,relationship,You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
test,relationship,"Certainly , perhaps ."
test,relationship,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is ."
test,relationship,"Hey , Isabelle ..."
test,relationship,Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
test,relationship,"Yes , I am the guy ."
test,relationship,What a bummer ! You set me up ?
test,relationship,Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
test,relationship,How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
test,relationship,"Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !"
test,relationship,Why did you lie to me in the email ?
test,relationship,I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .
test,relationship,I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
test,relationship,"I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over ."
test,relationship,"Peter , how often do you exercise ?"
test,relationship,"Well , I swim and run every day ."
test,relationship,"Now , tell me , what do you eat ?"
test,relationship,"Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs ."
test,relationship,Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
test,relationship,"Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit ."
test,relationship,What do you drink ?
test,relationship,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you ."
test,relationship,What do you drink ?
test,relationship,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
test,relationship,Yeah .
test,relationship,Who won ?
test,relationship,China .
test,relationship,What was the score ?
test,relationship,China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .
test,relationship,Wonderful !
test,relationship,"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work ."
test,relationship,I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
test,relationship,"Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client ."
test,relationship,"I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman ."
test,relationship,"It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale ."
test,relationship,"Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !"
test,relationship,Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
test,relationship,What do you mean ?
test,relationship,I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
test,relationship,"Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall ."
test,relationship,It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
test,relationship,"You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering ."
test,relationship,What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
test,relationship,Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St . Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .
test,relationship,What's there after that ?
test,relationship,"Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world ."
test,relationship,What are they all for ?
test,relationship,"Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places ."
test,relationship,"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?"
test,relationship,I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
test,relationship,What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
test,relationship,Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
test,relationship,And your parents took it badly ?
test,relationship,That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
test,relationship,"Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?"
test,relationship,"She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away ."
test,relationship,How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
test,relationship,Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
test,relationship,Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
test,relationship,What do you mean ?
test,relationship,"Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not ."
test,relationship,"I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out ."
test,relationship,Do you think they two will get married ?
test,relationship,"Yeah , you can count on it ."
test,relationship,"I think so . Yes , they get along so well ."
test,relationship,I like him . He's good for her .
test,relationship,You're right . He sure is .
test,relationship,What do you think of Frank ?
test,relationship,He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .
test,relationship,Why do you say that ?
test,relationship,"Whatever things get tough , he gives in ."
test,relationship,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
test,relationship,Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
test,relationship,I sure hope so .
test,school_life,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?"
test,school_life,"Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss . Parker speaks to us only in English ."
test,school_life,I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
test,school_life,Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
test,school_life,It must be interesting to study English .
test,school_life,Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
test,school_life,Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
test,school_life,Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
test,relationship,It's quiet everywhere in winter .
test,relationship,Yes . I like winter .
test,relationship,Me too .
test,relationship,It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?
test,relationship,That's a good idea . Let's go !
test,relationship,What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .
test,relationship,Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .
test,relationship,I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
test,relationship,Yes . Very wonderful .
test,relationship,There is a snowman over there .
test,relationship,How lovely it is !
test,relationship,Tim's always bothering me .
test,relationship,Just tell him off .
test,relationship,Who are those guys ?
test,relationship,"Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players ."
test,relationship,Oh .
test,relationship,"Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !"
test,relationship,All right !
test,relationship,"Here comes Jordan , though ."
test,relationship,"Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch ."
test,relationship,"Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing ."
test,relationship,Which team do you think will win ?
test,relationship,The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
test,school_life,"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr . Stone ."
test,school_life,It's ok . What do you want to ask ?
test,school_life,Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
test,school_life,The first place you should go is the International Center .
test,school_life,Why ?
test,school_life,You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
test,school_life,What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
test,school_life,"They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you ."
test,school_life,Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
test,school_life,"Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office ."
test,school_life,I see . It must be worth going to .
test,school_life,"Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year ."
test,school_life,Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .
test,school_life,"It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"hi , Lander . What's wrong ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,I can hardly make ends meet these days .
test,attitude_and_emotion,same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
test,attitude_and_emotion,my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
test,attitude_and_emotion,true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
test,attitude_and_emotion,definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,is that inflation ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
test,attitude_and_emotion,but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
test,attitude_and_emotion,you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
test,attitude_and_emotion,how ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,"for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,sounds a good idea .
test,relationship,"OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing ."
test,relationship,You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
test,relationship,Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
test,relationship,You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
test,relationship,"The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !"
test,relationship,"Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men ."
test,culture_and_educastion,Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?
test,culture_and_educastion,"Yeah , almost . But there is one thing ."
test,culture_and_educastion,What ?
test,culture_and_educastion,"I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ..."
test,culture_and_educastion,What is it ?
test,culture_and_educastion,Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
test,culture_and_educastion,That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
test,culture_and_educastion,Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
test,culture_and_educastion,Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
test,culture_and_educastion,"I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding ."
test,culture_and_educastion,"Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus ."
test,culture_and_educastion,Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
test,culture_and_educastion,Yeah .
test,culture_and_educastion,"Oh , I'm shocked ."
test,school_life,What courses did you take in college ?
test,school_life,"I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc ."
test,school_life,Which course did you like best ?
test,school_life,I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .
test,relationship,Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?
test,relationship,Certainly . What's the matter ?
test,relationship,I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
test,relationship,Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
test,relationship,Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
test,relationship,"That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place ."
test,relationship,Is the service charged ?
test,relationship,No . it's free .
test,relationship,Really . I'll get a computer at once .
test,attitude_and_emotion,We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?
test,attitude_and_emotion,It ' s so cool !
test,relationship,"Excuse me , is this seat taken ?"
test,relationship,I ' m afraid this seat is taken .
test,relationship,Oh . is it . Thank you anyway .
test,relationship,You ' re welcome . Why don ' t you ask the conductor when he comes by ?
test,relationship,Thank you .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
test,attitude_and_emotion,I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , that's how you see it ."
test,relationship,Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?

test,relationship,Is he really ?
test,relationship,"Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much ."
test,relationship,Who is he marring ?
test,relationship,"A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think ."
test,relationship,Have they set a date for the wedding ?
test,relationship,Not yet .
test,attitude_and_emotion,"OK . Come back into the classroom , class ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Does the class start again , Mam ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Oh , breaktime flies ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Come on , baby . It ' s time now ."
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Mam , another minute , could I ?"
test,attitude_and_emotion,"Hurry up , little boy ."

test,relationship,"Yes , I like collecting things ."

test,relationship,Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
test,relationship,"Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth ."
test,relationship,What a nice day !
test,relationship,yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
test,relationship,"great , let's go !"
test,relationship,"hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world ."
test,relationship,"exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ..."
test,relationship,"yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !"
test,relationship,"why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant ."
test,relationship,are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
test,relationship,"never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?"
test,relationship,"yeah , I think so ."
test,relationship,ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
